1,2,skyler,you have a good day sweetie
1,2,walter jr,okay mom you too
1,2,skyler,bye honey drive safe
1,2,walter,okay
1,2,jesse,yo yo yo 1483369 representing the abq what up biatch leave it at the tone
1,2,walter,so the term chiral derives from the greek word hand  the concept here being that just as your left hand and your right hand are mirror images of one another right identical and yet opposite well so too organic compounds can exist as mirror image forms of one another all the way down at the molecular level but although they may look the same they dont always behave the same for instanceim sorry for instance thalidomide the righthanded isomer of the drug thalidomide is a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman to prevent morning sickness but make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman the lefthanded isomer of the drug thalidomide and her child will be born with horrible birth defects which is precisely what happened in the 1950s so chiral chirality mirrored images right active inactive good bad yes ben
1,2,walter,what
1,2,walter,the chirality on the midterm no no well maybe maybe yes you know but prepare for it to be on the midterm cant hurt to know it right knowledge is power
1,2,jesse,oh no no not good not good
1,2,walter,what thehey you listen no no no no oh god
1,2,skyler,milfs what the hell is a milf
1,2,walter,now what the other one out in the rv hesyoure sure
1,2,jesse,yes
1,2,walter,positive
1,2,jesse,feel free to go check it yourself
1,2,walter,yes good idea maybe i should do that before he too wanders off on the damn street
1,2,jesse,okay you know what i
1,2,walter,all right all right the one downstairs tell me about him come on anything something start with his name at least
1,2,jesse,krazy8
1,2,walter,krazy8 what the hell does that even mean
1,2,jesse,i dont know man okay i mean hes like krazy8 okay i dont know
1,2,walter,so you work with him regularly
1,2,jesse,no not him so much his cousin mainly
1,2,walter,whos his cousin
1,2,jesse,the guy out in the rv
1,2,walter,all right all right
1,2,jesse,krazy8s one level higher
1,2,walter,one level higher
1,2,jesse,yeah you know not like street level higher you know theres like a starbucks at every corner krazy8 is like the dude that sells starbucks his beans
1,2,walter,okay so hes a distributor okay so is he i mean is he in other words what is his reputation for volence
1,2,jesse,well um he did try to kll us both yesterday so theres that
1,2,walter,what im trying to say is that hes a distributor right hes a businessman hes a man of business it would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting out of mutual selfinterest yes
1,2,jesse,what
1,2,walter,do you think he is capable of listening to reason
1,2,jesse,what kind of reason like dear krazy8 listen if i let you go will you promise not to come back and waste my family no colombian neckties  you mean that kind of reason no man i cant say i have high fcking hopes where thats concerned what was that what was what come see we gotta tie him up why the hell didnt we tie him up
1,2,walter,because he was out cold
1,2,jesse,but what if hes faking it like if it was me id be all faking being knocked out yo and then when the coast is clear id be up looking for weapons and shit waiting to pounce
1,2,jesse,now if it was me and i couldnt find a decent enough wapon i would just lie back down and bide my time
1,2,jesse,so now what do we do
1,2,walter,you keep asking me that like you think i have some answer
1,2,jesse,well you gotta do something
1,2,walter,we we have got to do something and i am opened to suggestions
1,2,jesse,man uhuh okay this whole thing was your deal
1,2,walter,dont you dare put that on me you brought those guys out there this is your responsibility
1,2,jesse,like i came to you begging to cook meth hey nerdiest old dude i know you wanna come cook crystal please id ask my diaperwearing granny but her wheelchair wouldnt fit in the rv  what about the phosphate gas
1,2,walter,phosphine gas what about it
1,2,jesse,i mean do you think it still might kll him you know with like a delayed reaction or something
1,2,walter,i dont know
1,2,jesse,youre supposed to be a scientist
1,2,walter,look this isnt even the issue that demands immediate attention we have got a body in that rv and its getting warmer outside understand and we have got to do something about that soon and in a way that no one will ever find it now that last part is very very important therefore it seems to me that our best course of action would be chemical disincorporation dissolving in strong acid

1,4,walter,actually your mother wasnt a waitress it was a summer job and she was the hostess and she also worked the cash register and i used to go in there a lot because it was close enough to the lab where i could ride my bicycle and once i noticed her it got to be so that i would only go in when i knew she was working when it was slow she would lean against the counter doing her crossword puzzles but kind of hiding it right pretending that she was still working and once i caught on to that i would do crossword puzzles while i ate my grilled cheese sandwich it got so that everyday at lunch we would both be doing the new york times crossword puzzle ten feet from each other eventually i caught her looking over at me so i began saying excuse me fourteen across sevenletter word for whatchamacallit may i ask what you wrote down that got us talking boy i tell you i was terrible at those puzzles i dont think that i finished even one of them but your mother would do them in ink

1,5,marie,hank what the hell are you saying
1,5,skyler,please marie let him talk thats what were here to do please go on hank
1,5,hank,right well look at it this way okay its the bottom of the 9th bases are loaded youre up but you got a bum arm right theres no frickin way youre gonna hit a homer so you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat or you can hold onto your pride and lose the game get what im saying
1,5,walter,no
1,5,hank,you got your pride man i get it okay i get it if this daddy warbucks wants to chip in im with your old lady on this one i say take the money and run you know somebody wanna to take this thing here
1,5,skyler,yes walter jr im sure you have about a million things to say probably and now is your chance go ahead just let it all out
1,5,walter jr,this is bullshit
1,5,walter,hey come on
1,5,skyler,its all right talk tell your dad how you feel
1,5,walter jr,im pissed off
1,5,skyler,tell him
1,5,walter jr,im pissed off cause youre being youre a pssy youre like ready to give up what if you gave up on me huh this here all the stuff ive been through and youre scared of a little chemotherapy
1,5,marie,me personally i think you should do whatever you want to do
1,5,skyler,what
1,5,marie,you told us to be honest about our feelings walts the one with cancer its his decision its not up to any of us
1,5,skyler,why in the hell would you do this
1,5,marie,i wasnt planning on agreeing with walt but after sitting here and listening to you all talk about his future like he has no say in it
1,5,skyler,hes not gonna have a future if he doesnt get treatment
1,5,marie,i am a medical professional i xray people in treatment every day i see them every day and you know what some of them are absolutely miserable
1,5,skyler,marie
1,5,marie,im sorry but its true and some of them dont wanna spend their last weeks or months being picked at by doctors but they got talked into it by their families
1,5,hank,could i get the pillow back i agree with marie on that what maybe walt wants to die like a man
1,5,skyler,i dont want him to die at all thats the whole point of this so either help or leave
1,5,marie,skyler i just wanted to do you the courtesy of giving you my honest opinion
1,5,skyler,you know marie this is not a debate club this is my husbands life
1,5,marie,i make one simple observation
1,5,skyler,my husbands life were talking about
1,5,hank,ladies come on
1,5,skyler,how dare you
1,5,walter jr,this is so stupid
1,5,walter,all right ive got the talking pillow now okay we all in this room we love each other we want whats best for each other and i know that i am very thankful for that but what i want what i need is a choice
1,5,skyler,what does that mean
1,5,walter,sometimes i feel like i never actually make any of my own choices i mean my entire life it just seems i never you know had a real say about any of it now this last one cancer all i have left is how i choose to approach this
1,5,skyler,then make the right choice walt youre not the only one it affects what about your son dont you wanna see your daughter grow up
1,5,walter,of course i do skyler youve read the statistics these doctors talking about surviving one year two years like its the only thing that matters but what good is it to just survive if i am too sick to work to enjoy a meal to make love for what time i have left i want to live in my own house i want to sleep in my own bed i dont wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day lose my hair and lie around too tired to get up and so nauseated that i cant even move my head and you cleaning up after me me with some dead man some artificially alive just marking time no no and thats how you would remember me thats the worst part so that is my thought process skyler im sorry i just i choose not to do it
1,5,walter,all right
1,5,skyler,all right what
1,5,walter,ill do the treatment its gonna be okay
1,5,skyler,the lady from the billing office said they usually bill the insurance company directly but since our hmo is not paying for it we can pay up front with a credit card
1,5,walter,good
1,5,skyler,and then elliott will send a check
1,5,walter,i will take care of it
1,5,walter,yes
1,5,skyler,okay see you in a minute

1,5,walter,yeah well thank you
1,5,gretchen,walt elliotts told me he had offered to pay for the treatment you have to accept that money as far as were both concerned that belongs to you even the name of our company its half yours walt is this about you and me
1,5,walter,gretchen i really appreciate the offer i do but were fine as it turns out the insurance came through after all so i am covered well anyway i really appreciate it thank you

1,6,walter,lets get something straight this the chemistry is my realm i am in charge of the cooking out there on the street you deal with that as far as our customers go i dont wanna know anything about them i dont want to see them i dont want to hear from them i want no interaction with them whatsoever this operation is you and me and im the silent partner you got any issues with that
1,6,jesse,whatever man
1,6,walter,no matter what happens no more bloodshed no volence
1,6,skyler,walt you all right
1,6,walter,oh yeah yeah im okay you know honey you really dont have to
1,6,skyler,look i like being here with you
1,6,walter,im only saying that id be okay with it really if you want to go you know actually it would make me feel a little better knowing that you were there when walter jr gets home from school
1,6,skyler,okay all right youll call me when youre finished
1,6,walter,oh yeah
1,6,skyler,and have you been in touch with elliott because i havent seen a check from him

1,6,walter,could you not deposit this until monday thank you
1,6,walter,yeah
1,6,walter,chemical reactions involve change on two levels matter and energy when a reaction is gradual the change in energy is slight i mean you dont even notice the reaction is happening for example when rust collects on the underside of a car but if a reaction happens quickly otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way that generates enormous bursts of energy who can give me an example of rapid chemical reaction hint hint right here
1,6,walter,yes good explosions explosions are the result of chemical reactions happening almost instantaneously and the faster reactants i e  explsives and fulminated mercury is a prime example of that the faster they undergo change the more violent the explsin so explosions okay listen why dont you start reading on your own from the top of chapter 7 all right
1,6,walter,thanks hugo
1,6,skyler,hes starting to lose weight which is tough to see that you know to feel the difference when i put my arms around him can i talk to him

1,6,walter,no

1,6,walter jr,yeah dad whats up with that
1,6,walter,well i like to be alone i mean at times and its not about you really its just that sometimes it feels better not to talk at all about anything to anyone
1,6,walter,well i like to go on walks a couple of times a week maybe more after work and i really enjoy nature you know the cacti the vegetation that kind of thing its really very therapeutic

1,6,jesse,ive been out there all night slinging crystal you think its cake moving a pound of meth one teenth at a time
1,6,walter,why are you selling it in such small quantities why dont you just sell the whole pound at once
1,6,jesse,to who what do i look like scarface
1,6,walter,this is unacceptable i am breaking the law here this return is too little for the risk i thought youd be ready for another pound today
1,6,jesse,you may know a lot about chemistry but you dont know jack about slinging dope
1,6,walter,well ill tell you i know a lack of motivation when i see it youve got to be more imaginative you know just think outside the box here we have to move our product in bulk wholesale now how do we do that

1,7,walter,you sure shes bound to find out
1,7,skyler,well maybe i can explain to her that we need a diaper genie more than a white gold baby tiara
1,7,walter,you know ive been thinking about what you said to dr delcavoli about alternative medicine
1,7,skyler,dont worry im not going to mention that anymore
1,7,walter,what i mean is that maybe there is something to it here look they do this navajo sweat lodge up by farmington healing ceremony its supposed to be good for your lungs im not saying that i believe in it but you know it might be an experience

1,7,jesse,damn straight
1,7,walter,okay hydrogen electrolytically produced yes
1,7,jesse,yeah like you asked i mean this crap wasnt easy to get it was expensive
1,7,walter,methylamine wheres the methylamine i dont see the methylamine
1,7,jesse,yeah well thats where i ran into some trouble
1,7,walter,what kind of trouble
1,7,jesse,well half this crap i could just buy right but this methylamine not so easy they got it locked down tight but i did find some pros who will rip it off for us but they want 10 grand
1,7,walter,so whats the problem you have the money
1,7,jesse,no had i already spent almost the whole wad i mean i got like 2 grand left i told you all this crap was expensive
1,7,walter,so these thieves did they say where they would be stealing it from
1,7,jesse,yeah a chemical supply place south of town they got guards and security cameras big ass steel doors thats why these dudes are charging so much what
1,7,walter,so why dont we just steal it ourselves
1,7,jesse,yeah how are we going to do that
1,7,walter,with this
1,7,jesse,so whats this stuff called again
1,7,walter,thermite
1,7,jesse,and that will cut through a lock because this is supposed to be one big ass lock
1,7,walter,in world wr ii the germans had an atillery piece its the biggest in the world called the gustav gn and it weighed a thousand tons and the gustav was capable of firing a 7ton shell and hitting a target accurately 23 miles away i mean you could drop bombs on it every day for a month without ever disabling it but you drop a commando one man with just a bag of this and he could melt right through and destroy that gn forever
1,7,jesse,jeez
1,7,walter,so yes i think it will cut through any lock were likely to find
1,7,skyler,its very nice but yes well it is from the store isnt it

2,5,walter,well how much do you think you can sell on your own say if i cooked during the days and you worked the nights
2,5,jesse,dude

2,5,walter,you want to know how much ive got left after completing my first round of treatment and financing the worlds most expensive alibi zero zip nothing ive got nothing to show for all of this nothing for my family which as you might remember was the damn point but seeing as throwing in the towel is not an option that leaves us with a total of two choices we go into business with yet another homicidal lunatic or you and i start you selling whatever you can
2,5,jesse,theres a third way
2,5,walter,and what would that be
2,5,jesse,we got to be tuco cut out the middleman run our own game

2,5,walter,all right i will admit to a bit of a learning curve and perhaps i was overly ambitious but in any case its not gonna happen that way anymore

2,6,gretchen,let me just get this straight elliott and i offer to pay for your treatment no strings attached an offer which still stands by the way and you turn us down out of pride whatever and then you tell your wife that in fact we are paying for your treatment without our knowledge against our will you involve us in your lie and you sit here and tell me that that is none of my business
2,6,walter,thats pretty much the size of it
2,6,gretchen,what happened to you really walt what happened because this isnt you
2,6,walter,what would you know about me what would your presumption about me be exactly that i should go begging for your charity and you waving your checkbook around like some magic wand is going to make me forget how you and elliott cut me out
2,6,gretchen,what that cant be how you see it
2,6,walter,it was my hard work my research and you and elliott make millions off it
2,6,gretchen,that cannot be how you see it

2,6,skyler,theyre cutting off the money
2,6,walter,what did she say exactly
2,6,skyler,not much it was abrupt she said something like im sorry to have to do this but elliott and i can no longer continue to pay for walts treatment i wish you the very best and that was it she sounded apologetic i guess it was quick she got right off the phone i was so stunned but i called her back and she didnt pick up so what do you know about this she and i had a perfectly nice visit this afternoon and then you come home and all of a sudden shes in a big hurry to leave and then the two of you are talking in the driveway what do you know that i dont where were you tonight

2,9,marie,good thats what you want some places skimp and they only do the pet im not naming any names but i just still dont understand why you dont go to kleinman
2,9,skyler,this is where walts doctor is
2,9,marie,with us you wouldnt have to wait until next week to get the results im sorry but these scans are not that difficult to read i could take one look at walts and tell you immediately how hes doing really doctors like people to think that theyre so much smarter than the technicians but you would be surprised how much they come to us for input
2,9,walter,never turn down a chance to hit the bathroom huh excuse me
2,9,walter,im fine thank you
2,9,walter,so howd we do
2,9,walter,see anything
2,9,saul,sorry actually the money laundering aspect is fairly straightforward but i gotta tell ya the nottellingyourwife aspect most people want to know why they suddenly got rich
2,9,walter,if she finds out its after im gone
2,9,saul,how much time they giving you
2,9,walter,weeks maybe
2,9,saul,sorry to hear it i was hoping we could make some real money together oh well lets crunch some numbers how much money are we laundering
2,9,walter,at this time 16000
2,9,saul,how long have you been doing this
2,9,walter,weve had some extenuating circumstances
2,9,saul,apparently all right 16000 laundered at 75 cents on the dollar minus my fee which is 17 comes to 9960 congratulations you just left your family a second hand subaru
2,9,walter,well just have to cook more a lot more
2,9,saul,yeah thats my legal opinion make hay while the sun is still shining
2,9,skyler,you know we should do something this weekend get our minds off the test results
2,9,walter,actually im thinking i should go see mom
2,9,skyler,really
2,9,walter,you know i never did call her
2,9,skyler,youre expecting the news from the scan to be bad god i need you to stay positive with me here i am
2,9,walter,positive is good im all for positive but positive doesnt change facts all right it doesnt change the need to be prepared
2,9,skyler,i know im just trying to be hopeful okay you know forgive me
2,9,walter,look i need to know moms going to leave you something if im no longer around i just need to get that straight thats all and believe me im going to earn every penny of it too complaining about her nurses the entire time juanita is hiding my ashtray a 30minute discourse about how the sugar packets are suddenly disappearing and oh shes counting every one of them you know ill be lucky if i get a word in edgewise
2,9,skyler,i actually think the news from the scan is going to be good perhaps you should prepare for that

2,9,jesse,the buzzer it buzzes when you put the keys in to let you know that the batterys on i know that it didnt buzz look i didnt turn the key or anything im not stupid did you hear the buzzer buzz its faulty its a faulty mechanism
2,9,walter,is this a genetic thing with you is it congenital did your mother drop you on your head when you were a baby
2,9,jesse,the buzzer did not buzz and you made me move the keys in the first place remember
2,9,walter,i see your point your imbecility being what it is i should have known to say jesse dont leave the keys in the ignition the entire two days
2,9,jesse,i wanted to leave them on the counter btch oh im sorry the work station
2,9,walter,all right so we need to jump the battery somehow
2,9,jesse,how
2,9,jesse,you going to be okay
2,9,walter,damn it
2,9,jesse,whats it taste like bad huh
2,9,walter,this is good right here there here red to red black to black positive negative all right start it up
2,9,jesse,the hells wrong with this thing
2,9,walter,you have to really pull
2,9,jesse,i am
2,9,walter,really pull not like a girl
2,9,jesse,you know what pull this i am pulling it just needs to warm up a little oh jesus
2,9,walter,well done as always just well done
2,9,jesse,god come on you btches hear me now damn it this is stupid okay now we have to use your phone
2,9,walter,this is ruined do you understand just ruined
2,9,jesse,i understand you hooked it up wrong and you blew it up
2,9,walter,that is not what happened
2,9,jesse,how do you know
2,9,walter,i wasnt the one who dumped out the last of our water thats what i know
2,9,jesse,there was a fire excuse me for thinking on my feet
2,9,walter,is that you were thinking now that we have identified the problem you and thinking thats the problem
2,9,jesse,look somebody is going to have to pick us up your wife is not going to notice one little call mr white come on
2,9,walter,all right look make it snappy the roaming drains the battery
2,9,jesse,all right yo skinny hey listen i need you to come pick us up now all right were stuck out here you got a pen for directions a pencils fine retrd just something to write with it doesnt matter all right so you ready so youre going to head west on the 40 for like what 30 miles and youre just gonna go past the casino with the big arrows in the parking lot big arrows giant arrows they light up and blink and shit you cant miss them but then youre gonna want to take it slow because theres this dirt road right before this white sign with a 3 on it okay now youre going to be way way out in the boonies okay like crazy far so you just got to keep heading down that dirt road for what
2,9,walter,about another 15 miles
2,9,jesse,really that far
2,9,walter,hurry up the battery
2,9,jesse,just go down that road for like 15 more miles i mean were way the hell out here and yo listen bring water leave now here hes coming
2,9,jesse,there was this guy on the discovery channel who broke his leg mountain biking and he had to drink urine for you know just until the forest ranger found him he said it tasted like really hot really old soda we should just call you know ill be quick just be like yo where are you
2,9,walter,all right
2,9,jesse,come on yo where are you so you saw the white sign hes almost here oh man were getting really freaked out all right so youre on the dirt road hes on the dirt road good you just crossed the river have you seen anything
2,9,walter,wait wait what river what river what the hell river you talking about man theres no river can youphones dead now what what now
2,9,walter,come on seriously
2,9,jesse,whats this
2,9,walter,im trying to tricklecharge the battery
2,9,jesse,seriously just by turning that thing
2,9,walter,the commutator its the part which generates the electricity usually this little piston engine turns it but considering its lying here completely totaledanyway apply a little elbow grease itll take longer a lot longer but theoretically it should work
2,9,jesse,theoretically
2,9,walter,it has to work you understand
2,9,jesse,can i try how much longer
2,9,walter,i dont know
2,9,jesse,you hanging in
2,9,walter,im good
2,9,jesse,its got to be ready by now right
2,9,walter,give it a little longer just to make sure were
2,9,jesse,methylamine doesnt spoil does it thats not why were here lie much push come on please god please why couldnt i have just gone to santa fe why what are you doing
2,9,walter,i had this coming
2,9,jesse,what
2,9,walter,i have it coming i deserve this
2,9,jesse,you snap out of it first off everything you did you did for your family right
2,9,walter,all i ever managed to do was worry and disappoint them and lie god all the lies i cant even i cant even keep them straight in my head anymore
2,9,jesse,you know what screw this im walking you can come or not wheres my other shoe
2,9,walter,jesse your body is running dangerously low on electrolytes sodium potassium calcium and when theyre gone your brain ceases to communicate with your muscles your lungs stop breathing your heart stops pumping you go marching out there and within an hour you will be dead
2,9,jesse,you need to cut out all your loser crybaby crap right now and think of something scientific
2,9,walter,something scientific right
2,9,jesse,what come on youre smart you made poison out of beans all right look we got an entire lab right here all right how about you take some of these chemicals and mix up some rocket fuel that way you can just send up a signal flare or you make some kind of robot to get us help or a homing device or build a new battery orwait no what if we just take some stuff off of the rv and build it into something completely different like a dune buggy that way we can just dune buggywhat is it what
2,9,walter,do you have any money change i mean coins
2,9,jesse,i got a bunch of them
2,9,walter,then gather them and washers and nuts and bolts and screws and whatever little pieces of metal we can think of that is galvanized it has to be galvanized or solid zinc
2,9,jesse,solid zinc right
2,9,walter,and bring me brake pads the front wheels should have discs take them off and bring them to me
2,9,jesse,brake pads what are we building
2,9,walter,you said it yourself
2,9,jesse,a robot
2,9,walter,a battery move
2,9,jesse,this doesnt look like any battery i ever saw
2,9,walter,well trust me it is a battery or rather one cell of a battery here cut up the last two sponges remember the electrolytes think about it a battery is a galvanic cell its no more than an anode and a cathode separated by an electrolyte right
2,9,jesse,right
2,9,walter,well anyway on one side we have mercuric oxide and graphite from your brake pads this is the cathode this is the positive terminal this is where the supply of current flows out from you see then here ill show you on the opposite side is our anode this its zinc its what we find in our coins and anything galvanized
2,9,jesse,so the sponge is the electrolyte
2,9,walter,no the potassium hydroxide is the electrolyte but yes thats what im soaking the sponges in good good and now what shall we use to conduct this beautiful current with what one particular element comes to mind
2,9,jesse,a wire
2,9,walter,copper
2,9,jesse,well i mean
2,9,walter,its copper the only question now is will this supply enough current and how many cells will we need maybe weve only got enough material for six put the lid on wait positive cathode anode damn that is good thats very good here we go
2,9,jesse,hows the
2,9,walter,its fine i know i can trust you to
2,9,jesse,yeah whatever happens your family will get your share so ill be hearing from you
2,9,skyler,i know enough already its

2,11,gus,im sorry im not following
2,11,walter,i sat here yesterday waiting to meet with someone i believe that person was you

2,11,walter,i dont think i am
2,11,gus,sir if you have a complaint i suggest you submit it through our email system i would be happy to refer you to our website
2,11,walter,i was told that the man i would be meeting with is very careful a cautious man i believe were alike in that way if you are who i think you are you should give me another chance
2,11,gus,i dont think were alike at all mr white you are not a cautious man at all your partner was late and he was high
2,11,walter,yes he was
2,11,gus,hes high often isnt he you have poor judgment i cant work with someone with poor judgment
2,11,walter,are you familiar with my product
2,11,gus,ive been told its excellent
2,11,walter,it is impeccable it is the purest most chemicallysound product on the market anywhere that is not the only factor you could charge twice the current rate for what i provide and your customers would pay it hands down now who i choose to do business with on my end is not your problem you wont see him you wont interact with him forget he exists
2,11,gus,i have to ask why why him
2,11,walter,because he does what i say because i can trust him
2,11,gus,how much product do you have on hand
2,11,walter,38 pounds ready to go at a moments notice will i hear from you
2,11,gus,i have your numbers you can never trust a drug addict
2,11,skyler,look i mean its all kind of little dribs and drabs but right here take keller for instance a couple hundred dollars here a few thousand there
2,11,ted,dribs and drabs
2,11,skyler,once you add it all up though and with keller the revenues are almost 10 less than was actually received and this is every quarter for the last two years when i saw that i got worried so i checked accounts receivable on other customers i found six other instances of revenues being underreported and ive only just started to look into it
2,11,ted,we have requirement contracts with a lot of these companies they anticipate their needs for the next quarter most of the time they overestimate so i just let them roll their overages into the next order and if i dont theyll go elsewhere obviously we forgot or didnt go back and adjust the revenue entries i know its wrong from an accounting standpoint but as you can see the moneys coming in eventually as you can see
2,11,skyler,right right but i got the old bills of sale and order forms out of storage to try and sort this out and most of the time theres no backup for the reported revenues at all in a few cases i found xeroxed copies with the dates changed
2,11,ted,all right you got me
2,11,skyler,were talking nearly a million dollars of undocumented revenue what are you thinking
2,11,ted,im thinking about saving a company im thinking about peoples jobs about their mortgages and pensions and their college funds for their kids not to mention my own
2,11,skyler,it doesnt mean that you have to break the law
2,11,ted,yes it does its right there in the books business is terrible the bank is on my back the irs is grinding me down to a nub if i dont keep up
2,11,skyler,people go to prison for this
2,11,ted,my dad built this company from nothing we make things here the people who work here are like family i cant let that all fall apart because of a couple of bad years dont report this please
2,11,skyler,im not gonna turn you in but i cant be a part of it
2,11,ted,i know i know i just wish im sorry i dont want you to go
2,11,jesse,yo if i know you leave a message
2,11,skinny pete,yo its skinny pete just checking in with you man we missed you at the funeral today the whole crew was representing even badger came all the way from fresno combos people his ma grandma cousins everyone was all choked up and shit man it was like emotional and you should have seen the coffin it was like this shiny white pearlescent like im pretty sure ive seen the exact same paint job on a lexus so were definitely talking highend anyway guess you had something bigger going down watch your back out there bro peace

2,12,jesse,how gay are you seriously
2,12,walter,pee in it theyre selling testing kits at the drug stores if you are clean i will give you every last dime no huh well i guess until then youll just have to depend on the kindness of strangers to get high that and your little junkie girlfriend
2,12,marie,not on her tummy walt
2,12,walter,im not putting her on her tummy ill put her on her side do you want to hold her back just in case she decides to do a little spitup ill roll up a nice clean towel like this and put it under
2,12,marie,hammacher schlemmer makes a proper one of those its hypoallergenic
2,12,walter,i think a towel will do what is it
2,12,skyler,your son hes just unbelievable come see what he did
2,12,walter jr,i told you its not ready yet
2,12,skyler,honey just show it to them
2,12,walter,my god son thats wonderful
2,12,marie,this is beautiful savewalterwhitecom well i for one am telling everybody
2,12,walter,wait a minute youre not asking for money are you son
2,12,walter jr,thats the whole idea louis helped me set up a paypal account and everything
2,12,walter,but we cant ask for money i appreciate it i really do
2,12,skyler,this was all his idea he worked so hard on it just let him help you cant ask him to take it down itll crush him
2,12,walter,skyler its charity
2,12,skyler,why do you say that like its some sort of dirty word
2,12,walter,this is insane i have so much cash onhand that i actually count it by weighing it on my bathroom scale and yet i cant spend it i cant tell my family about it all of whom think that i am right on the edge of bankruptcy its insane
2,12,saul,well i guess thats why gangsters had molls
2,12,walter,what
2,12,saul,gn molls havent you ever seen white heat
2,12,walter,ive seen white heat but i dont see how that pertains
2,12,saul,maybe you need a moll more than you need a wife who you cant trust with your secrets what good is money that doesnt spend if a tree falls in the forestyou get the point so communicating is out
2,12,walter,out
2,12,saul,well lets see what else is there theres always hey i found a big bag of money down by the railroad tracks works for me uncle murray oh many is the happy memory of uncle murray bouncing me on his knee we lost track of the old pervert years ago but what do you know he kicked it and left me millions
2,12,walter,it cannot be blind luck or some imaginary relative who saves us i earned that money me and now my son created his own website savewalterwhite com soliciting anonymous donations do you have any idea how that makes me feel
2,12,saul,yeah look at that its got paypal and everything
2,12,walter,cyberbegging thats all that is just rattling a little tin cup to the entire world yeah theres no deepseated issues there
2,12,saul,im looking at the answer here its staring me in the face do i have to spell it out for you
2,12,walter,no i know youre thinking that i should be funneling my money into my sons website but absolutely not no i am not going to have my family think that some mystery benefactor saved us
2,12,saul,not some mystery benefactor singular that would raise too many questions however stay with me here zombies i got a guy who knows this guy who knows this rain mantype he lives with his mother in her basement in belarus so good luck extraditing his fat russian ass wait hes a hackercrcker extraordinaire this guy can hijack random desktops all around the world turn em into zombies that do his bidding for instance he can make it so 20 or 30000 little donations come in from all over the us and canada all paid infull nice and neat untraceable from the goodhearted people of the world to mr walter h white cancer saint im getting a warm and fuzzy feeling just thinking about it

2,13,walter,since when
2,13,skyler,im taking the baby with me marie will pick up walter junior from school youll have the house to yourself for two days i want you to pack your things and leave
2,13,walter,why would i do that
2,13,skyler,hank has offered to help since you shouldnt be doing any heavy lifting i want you gone by monday morning i want you gone
2,13,walter,can you at least tell me why
2,13,skyler,because youre a liar walt two cell phones after all
2,13,walter,what
2,13,skyler,right before your surgery i asked if you had packed your cell phone and you said which one
2,13,walter,when i was medicated i could have said the world was flat
2,13,skyler,you know what i think i think you accidentally told the truth
2,13,walter,honey we have been over this asked and answered right
2,13,skyler,then it got me thinking again about all the strange behavior not the least of which was the disappearance out of my mind with worry calling hospitals checking the morgue your fugue state i had to believe that didnt i i had to find a way i mean who would lie about such a thing
2,13,walter,you tell me you tell me exactly what it is you think im lying about what im having an affair is that what you think
2,13,skyler,yes for the last few weeks
2,13,walter,with whom who am i having an affair with
2,13,skyler,my guess was gretchen schwartz something was going on between you i just knew
2,13,walter,jesus get me a bible to swear on if thats what it takes i am not having an affair with gretchen
2,13,skyler,i know i know youre not because i asked her it really took me forever to get in touch with her she was ducking my calls for weeks so i finally left a message what exactly is going on between you and my husband i thought that would get her attention and it did so she called me back and she finally told me the money for your treatment gretchen and elliott didnt give you a dime they paid for nothing you refused every offer they made you but that didnt make sense because i checked with delcavoli at the hospital and not including your surgery were nearly paid up over 100000 out of where out of thin air but then i called your mother thanks for that too but i thought maybe she has some money that i dont know about maybe she contributed its possible it turns out that not only is the money not from your mother she didnt even know that you have cancer you never went to see her i dropped you at the airport i picked you up you were gone for four days and yet she swears that you were never there lies on top of lies on top of lies could you just once do me the courtesy of not denying it

3,5,hank,i turned it down end of story

3,5,walter,what exactly is this ill tell you what i think it is a ploy a ploy to get me cooking again and an obvious one at that
3,5,gus,how do you mean
3,5,walter,as if i would seriously believe you would hire an addict jesse pinkman recovering or not
3,5,gus,you vouched for him previously i took you at your word
3,5,walter,no no no no let me be clear let me be perfectly clear jesse was capable of working under my supervision trusting him with a solo venture well thats quite another matter how he could possibly produce anything other than a mediocre product at best
3,5,gus,i am told his product was more or less consistent with the quality i had come to expect
3,5,walter,more or less more or less really boy that is thetalk about setting the bar low except you dont do that set the bar low therefore what conclusion am i left to draw that you believe i have some proprietary kind of selfishness about my own formula some sort of overweening pride i suppose that you think simply overwhelms me clouds my judgment but it doesnt absolutely not i simply respect the chemistry the chemistry must be respected
3,5,gus,i apologize for being so transparent would you take a drive with me id like to show you something
3,5,skyler,hi is everything okay
3,5,marie,shes already finished an entire bottle but she still seemed hungry then she fell asleep but i was thinking id give her another when she wakes up
3,5,skyler,yeah yeah absolutely absolutely fatten that baby up
3,5,marie,will do
3,5,skyler,was that it
3,5,marie,so where are you are you at work
3,5,skyler,yeah yeah im at work i shouldnt be much longer is that okay
3,5,marie,you know i love my little pookums you can leave her with me for the next 18 years as far as im concerned

3,5,marie,its hank
3,5,skyler,hank what about him
3,5,marie,i dont know how to talk to him i dont know what to say to him anymore i dont know how toever since el paso ever since maybe before
3,5,skyler,yeah god knows he went through a lot down there
3,5,marie,people blown up right in front of him blood everywhere and last week el paso said they want him back
3,5,skyler,yeah
3,5,marie,hes not going steve gomez is going in his place and i dont know how i feel about that
3,5,skyler,well hes certainly a lot safer up here isnt he
3,5,marie,of course and i want him safe but i cant tell what he wants he wont talk to me he hardly even comes home he works all day all night barely eats barely speaks to me its like somethings eating him away from inside hes just not the same hes not facing death it changes a person it has to dont you think i guess youve noticed a change in walt
3,5,gus,please
3,5,walter,what is this
3,5,gus,your new lab
3,5,walter,my god thorium oxide for a catalyst bed look at the size of this reaction vessel oh its gotta be 1200 liters where where how did you know how to put this all together
3,5,gus,i had excellent help as will you quite a lot of planning went into this
3,5,walter,i would say so
3,5,gus,the laundry upstairs ive owned it for years it receives large chemical deliveries on a weekly basis detergents and such there is nothing suspicious about it and my employees to be sure are welltrained trustworthy the filtration system is state of the art it will vent nothing but clean odorless steam just as the laundry does and through the very same stacks i need 200 pounds per week to make this economically viable you would choose your own hours of course come and go as you please so long as the quota is met
3,5,walter,sorry the answer is still no i have made a series of very bad decisions and i cannot make another one
3,5,gus,why did you make these decisions
3,5,walter,for the good of my family
3,5,gus,then they werent bad decisions what does a man do walter a man provides for his family
3,5,walter,this cost me my family
3,5,gus,when you have children you always have family they will always be your priority your responsibility and a man a man provides and he does it even when hes not appreciated or respected or even loved he simply bears up and he does it because hes a man
3,5,ted,any chance we could grab a quick bite the thai place around the corners pretty good

3,5,saul,gentlemen if we could come to some accommodation here now theres always a way to oil everyones lock this young man is prepared to offer you a sweetheart of a deal for doing precisely nothing
3,5,walter,really
3,5,saul,ten percent of all future profits from his solo venture thats money you get paid for walking down to the mailbox consider it a gesture of respect for your valuable contribution to the business thus far im sure youll agree thats fair
3,5,jesse,thats charity is what that is i do all the work he sits around on his fat ass judging people
3,5,saul,escalating stop so theres that but then theres one small detail clearly a mistake was made on the part of our mutual associate when he paid you half of jesses earnings he must not have realized that you two had come to a parting of the ways
3,5,walter,take it it belongs to you
3,5,jesse,youre damn right it belongs to me
3,5,saul,i knew i could count on you boys to play nice that almost brings a tear to my eye

3,5,jesse,what the hell is that supposed to mean
3,5,walter,well i hate to break it to you jesse but our mutual associate was only using you to get to me
3,5,jesse,what are you talking about

3,6,gus,morning
3,6,gus,why theyre doing nothing wrong okay lets put this on table 33 okay
3,6,gale,hello there mr white i presume
3,6,walter,oh yes hi sorry ill be right down
3,6,gale,hi gale boetticher
3,6,walter,hi youre my new lab assistant i take it
3,6,gale,yes i am i suppose youll wanna hear my qualifications i have my resume here for you i received my bachelors degree from unm my masters from the university of colorado organic chemistry with a speciality inits all right there
3,6,walter,xray crystallography really i could talk about that for hours
3,6,gale,i would love to
3,6,walter,but first im curious about this
3,6,gale,thats a little pet project of mine see in my opinion its all about the quinic acid level you want just north of 4800 milligrams per liter but if you overboil to get there youll leach your tannins bitterness yuck so i pull a mild vacuum that way i can keep the temperature no higher than 92 degrees celsius andjudge for yourself
3,6,walter,oh my god my god that is the best coffee ive ever tasted
3,6,gale,sumatran beans and i also have to give credit to the grind but thank you mr white
3,6,walter,walt please call me walt why the hell are we making meth
3,6,gale,hey tell me with the phenylacetic acid solution you said 150 drops per minute for the first 10 minutes and then 90 for the remainder why is that
3,6,walter,well my thinking is by tapering the phenyl you get an oilier aqueous layer and hence
3,6,gale,better benzene extraction
3,6,walter,exactly but actually i prefer ether
3,6,gale,oh ill have it for tomorrow
3,6,walter,gale im wondering how you
3,6,gale,ended up here
3,6,walter,well actually im still wondering how i ended up here but yes i mean i cant imagine we strike each other as criminals
3,6,gale,well theres crime and then theres crime i suppose im definitely a libertarian consenting adults want what they want and if im not supplying it they will get it somewhere else with me theyre getting exactly what they pay for no added toxins or adulterants yeah i was doing it the way you are supposed to pursuing my doctorate at colorado nsf research grant i was on my way jumping through hoops kissing the proper behinds attending to all the nonchemistry that one finds oneself occupied by you know that world that is not what i signed on for i love the lab because its all still magic you know chemistry i mean once you lose that
3,6,walter,it is it is magic it still is
3,6,gale,and all the while i kept thinking about that great old whitman poem when i heard the learnd astronomer
3,6,walter,i dont know it
3,6,gale,anyway
3,6,walter,well can you recite it
3,6,gale,pathetically enough i could
3,6,walter,all right well no no come on come on yeah
3,6,gale,when i heard the learnd astronomer when the proofs the figures were ranged in columns before me when i was shown the charts and the diagrams to add divide and measure them when i sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lectureroom how soon unaccountable i became tired and sick till rising and gliding out i wanderd off by myself in the mystical moist nightair and from time to time lookd up in perfect silence at the stars yes i am a nerd
3,6,walter,bravo
3,6,gale,thank you
3,6,hank,come on pinkman you little rat bastard get off your lazy ass and go break the law hey baby

3,6,hank,are you okay
3,6,marie,yeah why hank whats up
3,6,gus,i told you before you will not kll walter white not until my business with him has concluded
3,6,gus,youll have to the decision is not yours to make explain to me why this man white he betrayed your cousin tuco yes but hes not the one who mrderd him was there not another man who pulled the trigger
3,6,gus,north of the border is my territory my say as a show of respect i say yes the agents name is hank schrader may his death satisfy you
3,7,jesse,hey you got nothing on me yo all right you can call my lawyer saul goodman talk to my lawyer all right you hear me i got nothing to say i told you you can call mychrist
3,7,hank,you got my cell phone number my wifes name how did you do it talk who you working with
3,7,merkert,yes sir if youre ready to talk they wanna get a statement your side of what happened here or we can hold them off till another time maybe you wanna talk to a lawyer
3,7,saul,there it is yo adrian rocky called he wants his face back come on i gotta cheer you up you see that thats your getoutofjailfree card you understand getoutofjailfree card i mean just blink once if youre following the deas worst nightmare is that face out in public theyll have to steer a wide berth of young master pinkman for fear of the pr poop storm that will rain down on them if this story ever gets out i mean this beating best thing for you youre home free good right right
3,7,walter,oh my god
3,7,saul,youre now the cute one of the group paul meet ringo ringo paul
3,7,walter,this isjesse im so sorry for this this should not have happened
3,7,jesse,but it did no thanks to you
3,7,walter,but the plan did work we wouldve been locked up right now if we didnt lure him away but this i just never saw this coming so what what happens now
3,7,jesse,what happens now ill tell you what happens now your scumbag brotherinlaw is finished done you understand i will own him when this is over every cent he earns every cent his wife earns is mine anyplace he goes anywhere he turns im gonna be there grabbing my share hell be scrubbing toilets in tijuana for pennies and ill be standing over him to get my cut hell see me when he wakes up and when he crawls to sleep in whatever rat hole is left for him after i shred his house down i will haunt his crusty ass forever until the day he sticks a gn up his mouth and pulls the trigger just to get me out of his head thats what happens next
3,7,saul,my advice thats probably not a good strategy theyre scared of you right now they want nothing to do with you but if you hit them theyre forced to hit back hard i mean they will turn over every rock hither thither and yon until someone spills the beans on you and anyone associated with you present company included
3,7,walter,yes i think what saul is saying makes a lot of sense jesse move on with your life leave it behind all of it
3,7,jesse,nothing changes once i walk out of here i get myself a new rv and go start cooking again
3,7,walter,how exactly do you think youre going to get away with that they will catch you
3,7,jesse,so what
3,7,walter,what
3,7,jesse,i have a getoutofjailfree card
3,7,saul,hey i may have overstated the power of your face
3,7,jesse,not this if the cops catch me i give them what they want the most you they nab me i make a deal to give up the great heisenberg and his milliondollar drug ring youre my free passbtch
3,7,saul,youre so sure
3,7,walter,look if he didnt give up my name while hank was beating him hes never going to talk
3,7,saul,what do you think that was a bluff he wants your brotherinlaw and theres gonna be lawyers creaming their underoos for a case like that id take it myself if it wouldnt cause so much collateral damage and him cooking again hey when not if he gets caught and hes facing 20 years whatll he do then believe me theres no honor among thieves except for us of course
3,7,walter,no hell come around
3,7,saul,and if he doesnt there may come a time to talk options
3,7,walter,options
3,7,hank,im convinced mr pinkman was involved in the manufacture and distribution of phenyl2 methamphetamine specifically what we call the blue meth i tracked him to a scrap yard where he stored an early80s camper an rv while waiting for a warrant to search this vehicle which i believe to be a rolling meth lab i received a telephone call telling me my wife marie had been injured in an accident upon hearing the news i left mr pinkman and his vehicle to tend to my wife arriving at the hospital i learned the emergency call was a hoax my wife fortunately was unharmed so i immediately went back to the salvage yard but the rv was gone most likely destroyed on site
3,7,hank,yeah thats correct
3,7,hank,so where do we go from here
3,7,merkert,a couple of gentlemen from opr will come down probably tomorrow morning janice will give us an exact time and you men will be continuing your investigation so thanks for your time
3,7,marie,its all gonna work out youve been too good to them for too many years
3,7,hank,i hope it goes without saying were not talking to anybody about this okay
3,7,marie,okay
3,7,hank,marie who
3,7,walter,hi
3,7,skyler,do you have a minute
3,7,walter,sure
3,7,skyler,i guess crime does pay
3,7,walter,i dont suppose you just came by to insult me
3,7,skyler,no we need to talk you heard about hank about what happened with this jesse pinkman
3,7,walter,yes i know
3,7,skyler,whatever hank was investigating him trying to find an rv is there any danger that could lead back to you
3,7,walter,no why would it is this why youre here
3,7,skyler,im here to talk about hank you know whats gonna happen to him if this pinkman presses charges hank could lose everything i thought maybe theres a way you could help him
3,7,walter,how
3,7,skyler,contact pinkman get him to drop the charges
3,7,walter,i dont know what kind of relationship you picture me having with this person
3,7,skyler,im not asking
3,7,walter,hes not my friend its not as if we were even close
3,7,skyler,im not asking but there must be something you could say isnt it even worth a try hank is your family

3,7,gale,i wrote it down you said 75 i wrote it
3,7,walter,well you wrote it wrong thats not what i said i said 85 its always been 85 not 75 not 95 eightyfive this is chemistry degrees matter

3,7,hank,swung at me
3,7,marie,he attcked you with a pipe
3,7,hank,a pipe
3,7,marie,it happened fast he resisted arrest and muscle memory kicked in and you had to disarm him muscle memory happens all the time years of training your body acted faster than your brain you had no choice but to hit him you had to fight back
3,7,hank,marie marie marie no im not gonna go in there and lie
3,7,marie,its some lowlife degenerate versus you doing the job youre supposed to why should you be the one who pays for doing the right thing
3,7,hank,oh baby it wasnt the right thing its not what the job is im supposed to be better than that

3,8,merkert,its standard procedure
3,8,marie,no oneokay all right listen if you all listened to him from the start and let him arrest that degenerate he wouldnt have taken things into his own hands and he wouldve had a gn and couldve defended himself

3,8,walter,what the hell are you thinking why are you calling me here
3,8,jesse,tried your cell and it went straight to voicemail how am i to get a hold of you
3,8,walter,you arent
3,8,jesse,its been a whole day how long is this grieving process just put a clock on it for me all im saying is we have a schedule right
3,8,walter,my family comes before your schedule
3,8,jesse,dude its not my schedule we have responsibilities here
3,8,walter,ill get there when i get there
3,8,jesse,you know what whatever ill just cook on my own
3,8,walter,you will do no such thing
3,8,jesse,why not
3,8,walter,well for starters you arent the least bit familiar with any of the equipment
3,8,jesse,theres gotta be some sort of manual right and i can read
3,8,walter,jesse touch nothing
3,8,jesse,stop treating me like im like your assistant im not your btch to order around were partners remember
3,8,walter,i need you to sit patiently and wait i will be there as soon as i can thank you very much for your kind words we really do appreciate that
3,8,jesse,what is your wife there
3,8,walter,yes yes she is she would be happy to know you asked about her please do keep us in your thoughts
3,8,jesse,hey tell your douchebag brotherinlaw to head towards the light
3,8,skyler,so im thinking maybe we should go get everybody some breakfast
3,8,walter,yeah that sounds good do you know who that was
3,8,skyler,you know these eggs are really not too bad
3,8,marie,look at that
3,8,skyler,look at what
3,8,marie,at what this these spots this fork is absolutely filthy tell me you see this youve got good eyes look at that
3,8,skyler,marie those are just water spots thats fine
3,8,marie,those are not water spots thats dirt this silverware has obviously not been cleaned its covered in germs from someone elses mouth god knows what
3,8,walter jr,seriously aunt marie its water spots ours at home arent any better
3,8,marie,yours at home are irrelevant were in a hospital they need to be of a higher standard they have a responsibility
3,8,skyler,well im not actually sure if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies as being part of the hospital
3,8,marie,its in the same building its all under the same roof do you think that sick people arent eating with this bacteriainfested silverware my god how are you supposed to survive this death trap
3,8,walter,marie i survived i had my lobectomy at this hospital remember that remember how scared we all were i didnt wanna act like it but i was terrified all that week all i could think of was how they were actually going to cut me open and take out a part of me that was with me my entire life i couldnt get that image out of my head i think the scariest part was when they took me into preop lying there waiting for them to anesthetise you knowing that you may never wake up again actually what i really remember about that day is driving to the hospital skyler you remember me wanting to drive that day
3,8,skyler,yeah
3,8,walter,anyway there we are were driving up central and we hit every green light i mean every single light that we hit green its just when does that happen just like bang bang green the entire way and the whole time all i could think about was why today why why cant i just spend a few extra minutes in the car with my family i never wanted to be stuck in traffic so bad in my life at least i was with my family i had that anyway i survived this place and im not half the man your husband is
3,8,gus,yes
3,8,gus,i was gonna ask you the same question
3,8,gus,why would they do that
3,8,gus,are you accusing me
3,8,gus,i assume that the next shipment will be delayed any thoughts on when it might arrive
3,8,gus,your man is in custody
3,8,gus,well keep me apprised
3,8,marie,all right and wheres that
3,8,marie,how long will that take
3,8,marie,thank you
3,8,skyler,maybe we should get you home for a couple hours get some rest
3,8,marie,im not going anywhere
3,8,walter jr,me neither
3,8,walter,well is anyone else dying to brush their teeth or is it just me what if i ran over to the house and picked up a few things marie i could swing by your place
3,8,marie,that would be great thanks walt

3,8,walter,well whats it about
3,8,walter jr,pablo escobar this big drug guy in the 80s
3,8,walter,yeah yeah i remember seeing him on the news
3,8,walter jr,well its more about the guys who investigated him and tried to bring him down some of them were dea you know uncle hank said that they were worth learning about that everybody knows who pablo escobar is but nobody knows about the guys that brought him down
3,8,walter,i guess i never thought about it
3,8,walter jr,he said that good guys never get ink like the bad guys do so he gave it to me figured id read it
3,8,walter,ill be right back okay okay
3,8,walter,no i assure you we are hard at work absolutely
3,8,gus,so i can expect delivery by tomorrow as scheduled
3,8,walter,well unfortunately were not going to be able to keep our schedule this week but not for lack of trying
3,8,gus,is there something i should know
3,8,walter,well to be completely honest with you gale really screwed us up i mean not on purpose of course but he just set us way back and weve been playing catchup ever since and ive had to be out running errands and trying to keep us on target some of the equipment wasnt calibrated correctly well its just all very technical and boring but rest assured that we will do whatever it takes it has my total attention well cook through the weekend if necessary we will have 400 pounds for you by next week

3,9,gus,how is your brotherinlaw
3,9,walter,hell live
3,9,gus,good im glad walter you seem troubled how can i help you
3,9,walter,i asked to see you in order to clear the air there are some issues that could cause a misunderstanding between us and i think its in our best interests to just lay the cards on the table
3,9,gus,thats the best way to do business
3,9,walter,my brotherinlaw moments before he was attcked someone called to warn him i believe that same person was protecting me those two men the assassins i believe i was their prime target but that somehow they were steered away from me to my brotherinlaw because of this intervention i am alive and yet i think that this person was playing a much deeper game he made that phone call because he wanted a sht not a silent assassination in one stroke he bloodied both sides set the american and mexican governments against the cartel and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the southwest if this man had his own source of product on this side of the border he would have the market to himself the rewards would be enormous were both adults i cant pretend i dont know that person is you i want there to be no confusion i know i owe you my life and more than that i respect the strategy in your position i would have done the same one issue which troubles me i dont know what happens when our threemonth contract ends
3,9,gus,what would you like to happen
3,9,walter,you know why i do this i want security for my family then you have it three million for three months that was our agreement extended annually 12 million a year call it 15
3,9,jesse,make more green man a lot more
3,9,jesse,i dont know i guess i would make something
3,9,jesse,i dont know if it even matters but work with my hands i guess
3,9,jesse,i took this votech class in high school woodworking i took a lot of votech classes because it was just a big jerkoff but this one time i had this teacher by the name of mr pike i guess he was like a marine or something before he got old he was hard of hearing my project for his class was to make this wooden box you know like a small just like a box you know to put stuff in so i wanted to get the thing done as fast as possible i figured i could cut classes for the rest of the semester and he couldnt flunk me as long as i you know made the thing so i finished it in a couple days and it looked pretty lame but it worked you know for putting stuff in or whatnot so when i showed it to mr pike for my grade he looked at it and said is that the best you can do at first i thought to myself hell yeah btch now give me a d and shut up so i can go blaze one with my boys i dont know maybe it was the way he said it but it was like he wasnt exactly saying it sucked he was just asking me honestly is that all you got and for some reason i thought to myself yeah man i can do better so i started from scratch i made another then another and by the end of the semester by like box number five i had built this thing you should have seen it it was insane i mean i built it out of peruvian walnut with inlaid zebrawood it was fitted with pegs no screws i sanded it for days until it was smooth as glass then i rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark it even smelled good you know you put your nose in it and breathed in it was perfect
3,9,jesse,i gave it to my mom
3,9,jesse,you know i didnt give the box to my mom i traded it for an ounce of weed
3,9,marie,hes a hero you dont deny coverage to a hero
3,9,skyler,theyll say theyre not denying coverage no no im agreeing with you but i went through all this with walt youll burn through your savings and then what

3,9,walter,listen marie i know skylers already told you this but if theres ever anything that you need anything at all
3,9,marie,its good to have you here both of you
3,9,walter,i just wish there was something more that we could do
3,9,skyler,walt we can always pay their bills
3,9,marie,please its tens of thousands of dollars
3,9,skyler,we have the money more than enough walt earned it
3,9,walter,skyler
3,9,skyler,i think marie should know the truth
3,9,walter,skyler i really dont think this is a good idea i think that
3,9,skyler,he earned it gambling walt and i weve had our problems lately you know that and what it all came down to really was money pure and simple when walt was diagnosed it changed him and looking back i dont think i ever really understood what it was that he was going through it was more than facing death it was knowing that he was gonna leave behind nothing and so thats how this all started for better or worse he wanted to provide and so he paid his medical bills the only way he knew how
3,9,marie,i thought that elliot and gretchen paid for your treatment
3,9,skyler,yeah i thought so too the truth is he never took their money not a dime he was too proud to take what he considered to be charity isnt that right so he put his mind to it andwell  you know how walt is hes a problemsolver and he read books and he did a whole bunch of research and he came up with this system
3,9,marie,a system
3,9,skyler,a system for counting cards in blackjack
3,9,marie,what do you mean like rain man
3,9,skyler,well i dont pretend to understand you know all the details but he was convinced that if he put enough money into it hed have agod what is it a statistical edge
3,9,walter,yes statistical soyeah
3,9,skyler,so every spare minute walt was at some card table somewhere and at first he went to the casinos but then he realized that the casinos report your winnings to the irs and if it gets reported your family might find out if you do not want your family to find out you find another place to gamble like an illegal backroom game you remember all those long walks that walt used to take all that time he used to spend away from home i guess for a couple months there you were sort of leading a double life werent you
3,9,marie,oh my god oh my god your fugue state was that some sort of cover
3,9,skyler,no no he did not fake that marie the night that walt disappeared he lost 14000 it was his pension fund our savings basically every last dime we had to our name gone he couldnt live with it he was suicidal but you have to understand that as soon as he got out of the hospital he went right back to gambling i mean thats how deep this went
3,9,marie,how could you do that to her walt
3,9,skyler,anyway this system of his he finally got it to work so all this is to say we have the money no more gamblingnbut we have the money
3,9,marie,how much money
3,9,walter,well its into seven figures
3,9,marie,holy mary mother of god
3,9,walter,what can i say i did very well
3,9,skyler,marie you will take our money use it to take care of hank please marie let us help
3,9,marie,does walt junior know about this
3,9,skyler,absolutely not and i need to keep it that way and hank okay hanks got enough on his mind right now can we please keep this between us
3,9,marie,yeah yeah yeah i just need to
3,9,skyler,yeah okay well talk about it later
3,9,walter,how did you come up with that i mean where did you possibly
3,9,skyler,i learned from the best somehow something tells me that hank is here because of you
3,10,jesse,surprised he doesnt make us do that
3,10,jesse,the pack totally has a pecking order and the head hyena hes the man you know all the other ones have to like kiss his ass i mean literally its so gross they have to lick his junk i cant believe they even showed it on tv yo if this is supposed to be all like majorleague and all we should have equipment maintainer guys and water boys you know yo gatorade me btch get us a couple flunkies in here treat us right okay 15 hours starts now im gonna hit it if thats cool with you

3,10,walter,no its not that its our output were off were 14 percent off
3,10,jesse,point onefour thats what like what does that mean

3,10,walter,thank you
3,10,jesse,you ever have like a wild animal trapped in your house
3,10,walter,not that i can recall no
3,10,jesse,we did this one time back when it was my aunts house back before she died of cancer it was a possum big freakyiooking btch hey since when did they change it to opossum whats up with that i mean when i was coming up it was just possum you know opossum makes it sound like hes irish or something i mean why they gotta go changing everything whatever its just big rats anyways giant pinktailed rats with their pink rat faces totally freaky like alien rats actually its not so much that he got trapped but he was living there you know under the house you could hear him going from like room to room always scurrying around sometimes id see him outside at night and it would just you know freeze i mean its like youre not looking right at it right i mean it thinks its fooling you thats what they do i mean they play dead or whatever its just so lame
3,10,walter,is there a discernible point to this story a point that youll be arriving at sometime in the near future
3,10,jesse,it was just a total btch to get out you know it took forever guy came set all these traps and all and he finally got it but my aunt you know she didnt believe it i mean she kept insisting she could still hear the thing i mean you could not tell her any different she started keeping an old umbrella you know by her chair man she would just bang on the floor and yell at it even gave it a name it was scrabble yeah that was it you know scrabble just knock it off she got like that toward the end got obsessive about stuff just got mad about stuff we didnt know what was up it wasnt like her to be that way but it turned out that the cancer had spread to her brain and that was why it metastasized but it was good that that was when we decided to take her to the doctor because then we knew what was up you know got her some treatment meds so she wasnt stressing all the time it was a lot better after that you know she was a lot happier where the hell is he
3,10,walter,ive been to my oncologist jesse just last week im still in remission im healthy
3,10,jesse,okay so good great
3,10,walter,well no end in sight thats great well i missed it there was some perfect moment and it passed me right by i had to have enough to leave them that was the whole point i mean none of this none of this makes any sense if i didnt have enough but it had to be before she found out skyler it had to be before that
3,10,jesse,perfect moment for what to drop dead what you saying you wanna die
3,10,walter,im saying ive lived too long i mean you want them to actually miss you you know you want their memories of you to bebut she just wont she just wont understandni mean no matter how well i explain it these days she just has this i mean i truly believe there exists some combination of words there must exist certain words in a certain specific order that would explain all of this but with her i just i just cant ever seem to find them
3,10,jesse,mr white how about you just sit down
3,10,walter,you know i was thinking maybe before the fugue state but before the fugue state i didnt have enough money so no not then and plus my daughter wasnt born yet it had to be after holly was born
3,10,jesse,mr white
3,10,walter,definitely before the surgery oh christ that damn second cell phone i mean how could i possibly i know the moment it was the night jane died yeah i was at home and we needed diapers and so i said id go but it was just an excuse actually that was the night i brought you your money remember
3,10,jesse,yeah i remember
3,10,walter,but afterward i stopped at a bar it was odd i never do that go to a bar alone i just walked in sat down i never told you
3,10,jesse,that you went to a bar
3,10,walter,no i sit down and this man this stranger he engages me in conversation hes a complete stranger but he turns out to be janes father donald margolis
3,10,jesse,what are you talking about
3,10,walter,of course i didnt know it at the time i mean he was just some guy in a bar i didnt put it together until after the crash when he was all over the news
3,10,jesse,janes dad
3,10,walter,i mean think of the odds once i tried to calculate them but theyre astronomical i mean think of the odds of me going in sitting down that night in that bar next to that man
3,10,jesse,what did you talk about
3,10,walter,water on mars family
3,10,jesse,what about family
3,10,walter,i told him that i had a daughter and he told me he had one too then he said never give up on family and i didnt i took his advice the universe is random its not inevitable its simple chaos its subatomic particles in endless aimless collision
3,10,jesse,hey come on hey sit down
3,10,walter,no no no its no no no that was the moment that night i should never have left home never gone to your house maybe things would have oh thought i was at home watching tv it was some nature program about elephants and skyler and holly were in another room i could hear them on the baby monitor she was singing a lullaby if i had just lived right up to that moment and not one second more that would have been perfect hes not coming down
3,10,jesse,must be thailandhot up there thats why he likes it thailands hot right
3,10,walter,yeah
3,10,jesse,then thats why

3,10,jesse,i didnt take shit
3,10,walter,im just saying that i wont be able to protect you
3,10,jesse,whos asking you to
3,11,jesse,yo i thought i was gonna see some like vaginas
3,11,jane,i didnt say she actually painted vaginas i said some of her paintings looked like vaginas
3,11,jesse,seriously not even close
3,11,jane,georgia okeeffe painted all kinds of stuff everyday items her surroundings some of it evoked an erotic nature its who she was
3,11,jesse,not like any vagna i ever saw this chick have medical issues
3,11,jane,this particular painting is of a door
3,11,jesse,any other doors we can check out like real ones or
3,11,jesse,you know i dont get it why would anyone paint a picture of a door over and over again like dozens of times
3,11,jane,but it wasnt the same
3,11,jesse,yeah it was
3,11,jane,it was the same subject but different every time the light was different her mood was different she saw something new every time she painted it
3,11,jesse,and thats not psycho to you
3,11,jane,well then why should we do anything more than once should i just smoke this one cigarette maybe we should only have sex once if its the same thing
3,11,jesse,whoa no
3,11,jane,should we just watch one sunset or live just one day its new every time each time is a different experience
3,11,jesse,okay fine i guess the cow skull pictures were cool but a door i will say it again a door
3,11,jane,why not a door sometimes you get fixated on something and you might not even get why you open yourself up and go with the flow wherever the universe takes you
3,11,jesse,okay so the universe took her to a door and she got all obsessed with it and just had to paint it 20 times until it was perfect
3,11,jane,i wouldnt say that nothings perfect
3,11,jesse,yeah well i mean some things
3,11,jane,that was so sweet i think i threw up in my mouth a bit
3,11,jesse,you cant admit just for once that im right come on that okeeffe lady kept trying over and over until that stupid door was perfect
3,11,jane,no that door was her home and she loved it to me thats about making that feeling last

3,11,walter,yes my guy is a top guy
3,11,skyler,who is he whats his name what are his qualifications walt this money has to be unimpeachable when it reaches hank and marie
3,11,walter,and it is it will be
3,11,skyler,but how do i know that i mean you cant even tell me the mans name
3,11,walter,jesus skyler do you really wanna know do you really wanna know really
3,11,saul,what a pleasure it is to have you im gonna call you skyler if thats okay its a lovely name reminds me of a big beautiful sky walt never told me how lucky he was prior to recent unfortunate events his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers only the very best with just the right amount of dirty thats a joke thats a joke its funny because you are so clearly very classy here please sit down so walt tells me that you have some concerns i can alleviate
3,11,skyler,yes i do i have concerns if were going to go down this road and clearly we are for the sake of my brotherinlaw
3,11,skyler,at any rate i need some assurances that were gonna go about this in a manner that is extremely safe and cautious
3,11,saul,fair enough ill walk you through the process first step is something we like to call money laundering all right take your money represented by say these jelly beans
3,11,skyler,you know im a bookkeeper so i actually know what money laundering is
3,11,saul,well
3,11,skyler,yeah and as with most things the devil is in the details so to begin with what are we saying is the source of this money
3,11,saul,thats simple walt here actually came up with a great story about gambling winnings blackjack right some cardcounting system
3,11,walter,well actually that was skylers idea
3,11,saul,well you grow more gorgeous by the minute there you have it ill generate false currency transaction reports out the wazoo as well as the necessary w2gs i know a couple casino managers who will jump at the chance to report false losses its a winwin for everyone
3,11,skyler,yeah but you cant sell that for very long
3,11,saul,yeah yeah yeah way ahead of you we declare just enough not to arouse suspicion then walts onetime winnings become seed money for an investment
3,11,skyler,investment in what
3,11,saul,drum roll please wait for it laser tag
3,11,skyler,laser tag
3,11,saul,seven thousand square feet of rollicking fun in the heart of northern bernalillo county
3,11,skyler,laser tag
3,11,saul,yeah theres gns and glow lights and kids wear the vests
3,11,skyler,yeah no no i actually know what it is its just that in relation to walt its i mean it doesnt make any sense
3,11,saul,makes more sense than you two being together
3,11,skyler,do you even know walt i mean how would he of all people buy a laser tag business it doesnt add up
3,11,saul,it adds up perfectly walts a scientist scientists love lasers plus they got bumper boats so
3,11,skyler,hey everybody walt suddenly decided to invest in laser tag just out of the blue really thats what were supposed to tell people our family our friends the government
3,11,saul,let me bottom line this for you you dont need to be involved okay ive been doing this for a lot of years successfully believe it or not without your help so thank you for stopping by
3,11,jesse,or something what do you mean
3,11,jesse,yeah ive heard it over and over and over again you know dont you think its ridiculous that society says beer is okay and a little hit of something sweet is wrong i mean whats the point of shutting yourself off completely from something that lifts you off the ground i spend so much energy fighting the urge not to use and i feel like crap because of it
3,11,jesse,what
3,11,jesse,see the thing is not to get caught you ever try that blue stuff thats going around just a little gas in the tnk and suddenly everything is interesting man i wish i could make that feeling last
3,11,jesse,what if i could get some
3,11,jesse,so you have a kid huh whats up brock huh thats a cool name here give it up
3,11,jesse,what yeah yeah hes cool
3,11,skyler,safe and cautious thats all im asking and that man is neither
3,11,walter,ill admit he comes across like a circus clown but he knows what hes doing and safe and cautious is you not being involved in this at all
3,11,skyler,well its a little late on that this is what happens when you decide to pay our bills with drug money
3,11,walter,skyler this isnt just about what happened before my involvement in this is ongoing understand i cant just quit i have something of a contract but its all very safe professional structured like i cant simply quit where you going
3,11,skyler,if youre gonna launder money walt at least do it right you worked here for four years its a business you understand its a story people will believe not laser tag this this is what we buy you this is what you buy
3,11,badger,yeah i mean theres free donuts nothings wrong with a free donut hey jesse right brandon peter how goes it hanging in there

3,11,walter,it makes a better story than your laser tag
3,11,saul,is that you talking or yoko ono
3,11,walter,she has a point it makes more sense that i invest right here
3,11,saul,based on her years of experience in money laundering i suppose if youre committed enough you can make any story work i once convinced a woman that i was kevin costner and it worked because i believed it all right has nothing to do with the story besides this dump isnt gonna work because it doesnt have a danny theres no danny here
3,11,walter,what in gods name is a danny
3,11,saul,danny runs the laser tag danny is the guy who had a vision where others saw a dirt lot he saw black lights rubber aliens teenagers running around with ray gns right like bugsy siegel in the desert when the stock market took a shit and danny got into trouble he went searching for exactly the type of situation were offering danny will look the other way to keep his dream afloat in other words danny can be trusted completely that guy the guy with the eyebrows that wont quit is he a danny you buy this place all you got is a big building that squirts water you got no danny here
3,11,jesse,yeah thanks what time is it

3,11,gus,walter youre right on time please come in i hope you like paila marinabits a fancy name for fish stewbit sounds like a cliche but indeed its just like my mother used to make it come on you can help me cookbthis is a chilean dish that i love but i never get to make it kids wont eat it but you know how that is
3,11,walter,sure
3,11,gus,do you mind would you slice the garlic very thin
3,11,walter,why did you invite me here
3,11,gus,were working together why not break bread together now the garlic it always amazes me the way the senses work in connection to memory i mean this stew is simply an amalgam of ingredients taken separately these ingredients alone dont remind me of anything i mean not very much at all but in this precise combination the smell of this meal instantly it brings you back to my childhood how is that possible
3,11,walter,basically it takes place in the hippocampus neural connections are formed the senses make the neurons express signals that go right back to the same part of the brain as before where memory is stored its something called relational memory dont quote me on that im rusty on my biology
3,11,gus,thats very interesting walter i would like to help you if i could
3,11,walter,help me how
3,11,gus,well when i first started out i made a lot of mistakes more than i care to admit i wish id had someone to advise me because this life of ours it can overwhelm you are a wealthy man now and one must learn to be rich to be poor anyone can manage
3,11,walter,what advice do you have for me
3,11,gus,never make the same mistake twice
3,11,jesse,hey whats up you you tomas i heard you were the man
3,11,jesse,crystal you think you could hook me up
3,11,jesse,for a teenth shit come on yo
3,11,jesse,hey whats up hey yo
3,12,walter jr,so if its okay i was thinking about using this one for the test moms brakes are very sticky and you barely press down on them and its like a screech
3,12,walter,sure
3,12,walter jr,but im good
3,12,walter,yeah youre great why
3,12,walter jr,are my feet okay i looked it up new mexico says all i need is a note from a doctor i know its not the right way and all but once i get my provisional i can keep working at it
3,12,walter,well as long as it gets you safely from point a to point b then who am i to argue
3,12,skyler,hi youre a sweet girl yes you are yes you are i know here you go here you go
3,12,walter,all right
3,12,walter jr,thank you
3,12,walter,got it
3,12,walter jr,yeah
3,12,walter,okay all right
3,12,walter jr,so 9 am saturday
3,12,walter,yes 9 am saturday
3,12,walter jr,so which means pick me up about 830
3,12,walter,ill be here with bells on
3,12,walter jr,what
3,12,walter,its just a saying dont worry i wont be wearing bells hey
3,12,walter jr,hey mom
3,12,skyler,hi do you have a minute
3,12,walter,yeah
3,12,skyler,could you keep an eye on your sister
3,12,walter jr,sure
3,12,skyler,thanks
3,12,walter jr,see you dad
3,12,walter,bye son hey good work today
3,12,walter jr,thank you
3,12,skyler,have you thought anymore about what we discussed
3,12,walter,thought anymore meaning reconsidered no
3,12,skyler,so show me the flaw in it
3,12,walter,flaws skyler flaws plural not singular where do you want me to start
3,12,skyler,hey i dont love this situation all right that you put me in however lets just stick with what makes sense here you took the money you won gambling invested it in the car wash you helped run you hired your wife as a bookkeeper because shes actually a bookkeeper that is a story an auditor can believe what am i missing
3,12,walter,you should just take this money that i give you and not look too closely at it so if god forbid i get caught you maintain plausible deniability
3,12,skyler,okay my estranged husband who when he was working made 43000 a year starts shoveling money at me and when the police come im supposed to say i never thought about it officers made sense to me really that in your mind is plausible deniability i tell you what walt id rather have them think im bonnie whatshername than some complete idiot
3,12,walter,so youre promoting caution here and you want a believable story that it seems to me is the safest way to make the best out of a very bad situation yes but im noting a little hole in your plot though why would your estranged husband be doing all this for you
3,12,skyler,because he loves his family and desperately wants a reconciliation though it may be hopeless and futile then again hed try anything
3,12,walter,im just not buying it no i think it would be better if the husband were no longer estranged yeah maybe if he were back sleeping in his own bed
3,12,skyler,and suddenly a fantasy story
3,12,skyler,not every night no
3,12,walter,six nights a week one night off
3,12,skyler,dinner two nights not weekends with 24hours notice
3,12,walter,five nights a week with no notice
3,12,skyler,three sixhours notice
3,12,walter,five nights a week two hours notice
3,12,skyler,four dont push it
3,12,walter,and i want my own key to the house
3,12,skyler,no
3,12,walter,for emergencies and appearances yes i am going to babysit my own daughter help my son with his homework i am going to be a part of this family that is how well sell your little fiction
3,12,jesse,how about we stop somewhere afterward and get a beer
3,12,walter,no thanks though maybe some other time
3,12,jesse,seriously get a beer with me
3,12,walter,what what the hell are you doing
3,12,jesse,thats ours right look at it and tell me if thats ours
3,12,walter,yes its ours now put it away what the hell is wrong with you where did you get that did you take it from the lab
3,12,jesse,i bought it from the two guys who klled combo they had combo shot down in the street and now its our product theyre selling which means they work for our guy right
3,12,walter,what no what is that thats hearsay do you have any proof
3,12,jesse,i heard it from the sister of the kid who shot him hear how i just said kid this kid hes 11 years old shot combo on orders these two scumbags they got him dealing they got him and you know hes not the first they use kids because hey why not easy to control easy to fool all they get is juvie if they get caught hearts and minds right get them young and theyre yours forever these guys klled combo they used this little kid like some puppet they used him to sht my friend
3,12,walter,so why are you telling me this
3,12,jesse,i need your help
3,12,walter,how
3,12,jesse,i need ricin
3,12,walter,oh my god oh my god
3,12,jesse,look these two  hey
3,12,walter,no
3,12,jesse,hey they gotta go all right i got the entire thing figured out
3,12,walter,no
3,12,jesse,the delivery method everything all i need from you is the poison thats all
3,12,walter,no  look
3,12,jesse,otherwise you dont gotta lift a finger
3,12,walter,no you dont know what youre talking about not even 
3,12,jesse,look you dont get how right this is you dont get how the whole entire world would be better off
3,12,walter,were not talking about this
3,12,jesse,i know a woman who buys from these two once or twice a week they sit in their car all day and they get hungry so she brings them food and they knock a few bucks off her price theres your delivery system right there i could be a mile away
3,12,walter,jesus a methhead youre trusting to do this
3,12,jesse,know what that methhead stood up to your brotherinlaw he questioned her for five hours she didnt give it up know how you know because youre not in prison right now
3,12,walter,well i know i would be in prison after this prison or worse and id be right alongside you no jesse you cannot be serious this is a ridiculous idea
3,12,jesse,its ridiculous what so youre saying its not gonna work how about back when it was your plan when we were gonna use it on tuco
3,12,walter,apples and oranges
3,12,jesse,guy eats ricin two or three days later he gets the flu or a heart attack and he keels over thats what you said untraceable back to us to me not even that other scumbag we work for is ever gonna figure it out it was a good plan back when it was tuco and its a good plan now
3,12,walter,tuco wanted to mrder us these guys dont apples and oranges do i really have to sit here and explain the difference
3,12,jesse,combo was us man he was one of us does that mean nothing
3,12,walter,why didnt you go after these guys two or three months ago
3,12,jesse,because i just found out about them
3,12,walter,whats to find out its a dispute over turf right i mean how hard could it have been for you to track them down on their turf and kll them months ago because back then you were too busy getting high feeling sorry now mrder is not part of your 12step program this is not some amends that you have to make what you are talking about here is pointless this achieves nothing it accomplishes nothing
3,12,jesse,if you dont see what it accomplishes then theres no way i can explain it to you
3,12,walter,jesse listen to me you are not a mrderr im not and youre not its as simple as that jesse
3,12,jesse,im doing it with or without you
3,12,marie,knock knock
3,12,hank,chrissakes marie you dont say knock knock you knocks like that
3,12,marie,i like saying it
3,12,hank,well thats not the rules okay
3,12,marie,you knock your way ill knock mine but look see i win
3,12,walter jr,not so fast
3,12,hank,christ again thats three in a row got a fricking paul newman over here

3,12,hank,how they swinging that
3,12,walter jr,i dont know
3,12,marie,hey did you know the doctors told your uncle hank he can get out of here anytime he wants
3,12,walter jr,oh yeah thats great
3,12,hank,yeah im not so sure about that
3,12,marie,why not what thats what they said
3,12,hank,because they want the room they hit the sheets with lysol reset the meter and wheel the next slob in we went over this marie drop it
3,12,walter jr,are you not well enough
3,12,hank,jesus kid you too do i look well enough im sh1tting in pans peeing in pitchers i cant move my legs got it
3,12,walter jr,so people in wheelchairs should be in hospitals what about people on crutches maybe i should be in here too is that what youre trying to say
3,12,hank,exactly deal you little prick
3,12,saul,btch you know im hourly right
3,12,walter,he promised me that he would be here
3,12,saul,oh he promised why didnt you tell me lets wait then thats a joke the kid aint coming okay so whats plan b
3,12,walter,i dont know i really dont
3,12,saul,well lets brainstorm you really think hes serious
3,12,walter,thats why im here saul the way he was talking he is going to do it or try at least
3,12,saul,okay so we pay him off
3,12,walter,no no its not about money its about getting him off the streets getting him to calm down maybe what if we maybecould you get him arrested
3,12,saul,you want your criminal associate taken into police custody
3,12,walter,no now listen i know it sounds risky but it wouldnt be anything that would get him into real trouble and nothing that could lead back to our business just some minor offense
3,12,saul,pinkman in jail i dont know im picturing it and
3,12,walter,no not jail as in jail jail im talking about one of those situations where youre in an orange jumpsuit picking up litter along the highway
3,12,saul,thats jail youre talking about a leveltwo joint something that keeps him off the street for 30 days
3,12,walter,then by the time he gets out tempers have cooled and hopefully we can move on
3,12,saul,well roswell correctionals pretty low impact you know in the past ive recommended springer but im hearing chancy things about their bathrooms since they renovated so
3,12,walter,so its possible right
3,12,saul,well it falls under my premium services package but you can afford that ill call my pi
3,12,jesse,you understand what you have to do and you can never talk to anyone right i mean ever understand
3,12,jesse,i found this stuff on the internet takes days to kick in just keep quiet and this wont ever come back to you you okay with this right just think of it like its the same thing as always youre just delivering some hamburgers
3,12,jesse,hey you got a kid right whats his name
3,12,jesse,all right imagine these two guys had patrick working as a mule making him kll people wouldnt you do anything to protect your kid
3,12,jesse,okay so these guys are using kids like that they gotta go right good tomorrow ill be in touch
3,12,walter,yeah i bet that tastes good huh hey come here baby okay here we go here we go what are you doing if you need to talk use the phone
3,12,mike,this isnt a phone talk walter your wifes out right isnt she something i got a granddaughter a few years older
3,12,walter,what can i do for you
3,12,mike,have a seat walter i spoke to goodman about pinkman and this plan of yours
3,12,walter,and
3,12,mike,im not gonna do it
3,12,walter,why
3,12,mike,because its moronic
3,12,walter,saul said youve done things like this before
3,12,mike,thats not the moronic part
3,12,walter,okay so whats the problem
3,12,mike,the problem is the boss wouldnt like it
3,12,walter,saul
3,12,mike,my boss your boss this is a professional courtesy no one knows im here understand but our employer would find out like always and if pinkman were arrested hed take it as a problem walt you got a good thing going here we all do you wanna risk it all on one junkie now i realize you two have a history but this kids been on the bubble a while now its a long time coming
3,12,walter,what is
3,12,mike,i used to be a beat cop a long time ago id get called on domestic disputes all the time hundreds probably over the years but there was this one guy this one piece of shit that i will never forget gordie he looked like bo svenson you remember him walking tall you dont remember
3,12,walter,no
3,12,mike,anyway big boy 270 280 but his wife or whatever she was his lady was real small like a bird wrists like little branches anyway my partner and id get called out there every weekend and one of us would pull her aside and say come on tonights the night we press charges this wasnt one of those deep down he loves me setups we got a lot of those but not this this girl was scared she wasnt gonna cross him no way no how nothing we could do but pass her to the emts put him in a car drive him downtown throw him in a drunk tnk he sleeps it off next morning out he goes back home but one night my partners out sick and its just me the call comes in and its the usual crap broke her nose in the shower kind of thing so i cuff him put him in the car and away we go only that night were driving into town and this sideways asshle is in my back seat humming danny boy and it just rubbed me wrong so instead of left i go right out into nowhere and i kneel him down and i put my revolver in his mouth and i told him this is it this is how it ends and hes crying going to the bathroom all over himself swearing to god hes gonna leave her alone screaming much as you can with a gn in your mouth and i told him to be quiet that i needed to think about what i was gonna do here and of course he got quiet goes still and real quiet like a dog waiting for dinner scraps then we just stood there for a while me acting like im thinking things over and prince charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants and after a few minutes i took the gn out of his mouth and i say so help me if you ever touch her again i will such and such and such and blah blah blah
3,12,walter,it was just a warning
3,12,mike,of course just trying to do the right thing but two weeks later he klled her of course caved her head in with the base of a waring blender we got there there was so much blood you could taste the metal moral of the story is i chose a half measure when i should have gone all the way ill never make that mistake again no more half measures walter
3,12,jesse,man i dont get this i dont get this at all all im seeing is the kid so where are they
3,12,jesse,burgers are getting cold

3,13,walter,well then lets stretch our price range truly i mean why buy a starter house when well have to move out in a year or two
3,13,skyler,did you win the lottery and not tell me
3,13,walter,im serious come on why be cautious weve got nowhere to go but up
3,13,walter,yeah
3,13,mike,walter you see us
3,13,walter,yeah i see you
3,13,mike,id like you to exit your vehicle and start walking toward us
3,13,walter,and then what im gonna need some kind of assurance
3,13,mike,i assure you i could kll you from way over here if it makes you feel any better walter youve been busy you want to put your arms out to the sides for me if you would you know i havent slept since thursday i was out all night cleaning up after you i need my sleep
3,13,walter,you said no half measures
3,13,mike,yeah funny how words can be so open to interpretation you get your car fixed

3,13,walter,no
3,13,gus,are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices
3,13,walter,im quite well thank you
3,13,gus,no clearly you are not no rational person would do as you have done explain yourself
3,13,walter,my partner was about to get himself shot i intervened
3,13,gus,some worthless junkie for him you intervene and put us all at risk some contemptible junkie who couldnt keep the peace for eight hours
3,13,walter,thats right he couldnt he was angry because those two dealers of yours had just mrderd an 11yearold boy
3,13,gus,i heard about it he should have let me take care of them
3,13,walter,maybe then again maybe he thought it was you who gave the order
3,13,gus,are you asking me if i ordered the mrder of a child
3,13,walter,i would never ask you that
3,13,gus,where is pinkman now
3,13,walter,i wouldnt know a couple of time zones away at least beyond that id only be guessing he has enough money to last forever he knows he needs to keep moving youll never find him
3,13,mike,i dont know walt its what i do after all
3,13,walter,hes out of the picture i saved his life i owed him that but now he and i are done which is exactly what you wanted isnt it youve always struck me as a very pragmatic man so if i may i would like to review options with you of which it seems to me you have two option a you kll me right here and now apparently i have made that very easy for you you can kll me no witnesses and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down jesse pinkman and you kll him too a pointless exercise it seems to me but that is option a
3,13,gus,what is option b
3,13,walter,i continue cooking you and i both forget about pinkman we forget this ever happened we consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement i prefer option b
3,13,gus,youd need a new assistant
3,13,walter,i could get right on that
3,13,gus,no this time i choose
3,13,mike,your car get it fixed

3,13,gale,because whatever my shortcomings last time i intend for things to go perfectly from here on out so if there is
3,13,walter,gale youre great seriously

3,13,gus,oh no no thank you im sorry for the inconvenience
3,13,gale,oh no no its no inconvenience
3,13,gale,i need to talk to you about something something rather pressing if push came to shove i was wondering how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself you and an assistant
3,13,gale,why would why would push come to shove
3,13,gus,has walter ever talked to you about why he got into this particular line of work
3,13,gale,uh i guess i assumed it was because it pays so well
3,13,gus,oh it is but specifically has he ever spoken to you about his health problems oh im not surprised hes a very private person
3,13,gale,what exactly are his health problems
3,13,gus,hes dying of cancer it is why he does this to provide for his family which he has accomplished they will never want for anything hes seen to that
3,13,gale,well how long does he have
3,13,gus,that is very much the question he does not want to talk about it and every time i bring it up with him hmm i dont know that hes fully accepted the reality of it and not to sound coldblooded but i am running a business here
3,13,gale,no i i understand
3,13,gus,i have a very large investment in this there is so much overhead that i cant afford to shut down not even for a week so you understand my concern and my desire for continuity
3,13,gale,i do absolutely
3,13,gale,the worstcase scenario uh i suppose if we had at least a few more cooks together
3,13,gus,you dont think youre ready now
3,13,gale,well he is such a master theres always more for me to learn but im thinking that if we had say one or two more cooks one more i guess would do it i suppose i believe in you gale i know that when the time comes you will be ready
3,13,gale,whats up walt
3,13,walter,hmm
3,13,gale,is there um any particular trick to purging the catalyst bed
3,13,walter,no its pretty straightforward ill show you when we get there

3,13,walter,well he asks a lot of questions about the cooking process i try to be as vague as possible but i got that guy victor watching me listening to every word i say maybe the only thing thats saving me is gales fastidiousness once he feels confident that he knows my entire method
3,13,jesse,so what do we do
3,13,walter,you know what we do
3,13,jesse,theres got to be some other way maybe its better for you to just go to the cops all right i mean i cant believe im saying that at all but for your family the dea would love you all the shit you could tell them federal witness protection thats a good deal as for me ill hit the road yo i mean ill make it we had a we had a good run but its over

4,1,walter,i mean is 1 phenyl 1 hydroxyl 2 methylaminopropane containing of course chiral centers at carbons number 1 and 2 on the propane chain
4,1,walter,then reduction to methamphetamine eliminates which chiral center is it again

4,1,walter,hmm
4,1,jesse,where is he going to find another chemist

4,1,jesse,yeah
4,1,walter,its parked three blocks down on the right
4,1,jesse,yeah
4,2,lawson,wipe down this
4,2,lawson,i heard you broke new ground today
4,2,lawson,i walked 16 feet in 20 minutes
4,2,badger,yeah i guess i broke new ground
4,2,lawson,you worked here four years
4,2,walter,its a story people would believe
4,2,skinny pete,this is what we buy
4,2,badger,slow down
4,2,lawson,oh god
4,2,lawson,at the first opportunity gus will kll us
4,2,mike,how does it look
4,2,lawson,you mean in do i see it
4,2,walter,yes
4,2,lawson,do you see it
4,2,lawson,basically any lawman worth his salts going to spot that yeah
4,2,lawson,assuming thats a deal breaker
4,2,walter,yes
4,2,lawson,its a deal breaker
4,2,lawson,well if stealth is what youre aspiring to you best go with something more compact
4,2,lawson,38 special snub nose
4,2,lawson,got a concealed hammer so it doesnt catch on your belt when you draw
4,2,walter,tried and true no nonsense about it
4,2,badger,five shts
4,2,mike,atmatic has how many
4,2,skinny pete,ten in the mag one in the chamber
4,2,lawson,if you cant get it done with five then youre into spraying prey in which case i wouldnt count on another six closing the deal
4,2,lawson,you load that with 158 grain hollow points instead of your standard wad cutters
4,2,walter,its got plenty of stopping power
4,2,mike,cant get more dependable than a wheel gn
4,2,walter,here
4,2,lawson,um try it on with this
4,2,lawson,that snub youll conceal real nice if you carry it iwb
4,2,lawson,little harder to draw from but theres really no substitute if youre intent of fooling a vigilant eye
4,2,mike,comes in polymer too
4,2,walter,i prefer the feel of leather
4,2,badger,old school i guess
4,2,lawson,yeah um you sure its on the correct side
4,2,lawson,if youre righthanded it is
4,2,lawson,i dont know ma are you sure because maybe itll feel better on the left side
4,2,lawson,general rule you dont want to cross draw not unless youre going to be sitting you know store clerks card gamers and such
4,2,lawson,either way youre going to want to practice your draw a lot because if youre all fingers well it might could be him keeping a piece instead of you
4,2,mike,catch my drift
4,2,lawson,whats this
4,2,lawson,that there is why youre going to pay me five times what youd pay your neighborhood gn store
4,2,lawson,serial number has been filed off
4,2,lawson,so to state the obvious i dont want to be caught with this on me
4,2,lawson,no sir to state the obvious you dont
4,2,lawson,you know mister ive been providing my services for the past 30odd years
4,2,lawson,youd think in that time id learn better than to ask a man his business especially about one referred by the lawyer but i do feel the urge to ask you we strictly talking defense here
4,2,walter,yes absolutely defense
4,2,walter,why
4,2,lawson,because if its just personal protection aside from a bucket of money youd save yourself a potential felony twospot for carrying a wapon with a defaced serial number if youd just buy it legally
4,2,walter,yeah but if you did have to use it wouldnt it still be better to use one that couldnt be traced
4,2,lawson,this is the west boss
4,2,lawson,new mexicos not a retreat jurisdiction
4,2,lawson,man steps to you bent on doing bodily harm youve got every right to plant your feet and sht to kll
4,2,lawson,some call it a moral right and i do include myself within that class
4,2,lawson,all this to say im happy to take your money but if youre not a convicted felon you might best be advised to bear your arms within the confines of the law
4,2,walter,its for defense
4,2,lawson,defense
4,2,walter,ill take it
4,2,mike,thanks bonnie
4,2,badger,jesse
4,2,badger,whats up brother

4,2,badger,its got like parametric equalization
4,2,lawson,automatically adjusts the levels to changes in like air pressure and whatnot

4,2,lawson,its 120 decibels without breaking a sweat
4,2,lawson,hold on to your hats btches
4,2,lawson,hey man i saw andrea at a meeting yesterday
4,2,lawson,she asked about you

4,2,badger,thats a fair point i guess
4,2,badger,okay
4,2,badger,okay
4,2,badger,okay
4,2,badger,call of duty world at wr zombie mode

4,2,skinny pete,zombies are dead man
4,2,skinny pete,what difference does it make what their job was when they was living
4,2,badger,dude you are so historically retrded
4,2,badger,nzi zombies dont want to eat you just because theyre craving the protein
4,2,badger,they do it because they do it because they hate americans man
4,2,badger,talibans theyre the talibans of the zombie world

4,2,skinny pete,and no more excuses
4,2,badger,wolynetz my name is skyler white
4,2,lawson,how do you do
4,2,lawson,you want to buy my car wash
4,2,lawson,i do
4,2,lawson,and i am prepared to talk numbers right now if youd like
4,2,lawson,do you think this is an easy job
4,2,lawson,you are willing to get down on your hands and knees and scrub like a house maid with all the chemicals eating into your nice skin and stinging in your eyes
4,2,walter,well i know a thing or two about scrubbing
4,2,lawson,any other advice for me
4,2,badger,because i am serious about this
4,2,badger,i am serious too
4,2,lawson,i have worked 30 years of building this business from nothing with my own hands and my own sweat and blood
4,2,walter,i can appreciate that truly
4,2,lawson,so with that in mind is there a figure you can quote me
4,2,lawson,one which you think would adequately 10 million
4,2,walter,well lets try 879000
4,2,lawson,where do you come up with this number
4,2,lawson,you pull it from your behind
4,2,lawson,on a typical day you manage 19 cars per hour
4,2,lawson,extrapolating i added the extra revenues for hand waxes and detailing subtracted your overhead and salary and maintenance operating fees depreciation which i obtained from comparable businesses in the albuquerque area giving me an estimate of your annual cash flow here to which i applied the industry standard multiplier and added the market value of your real estate giving me a total estimated value of 829000 on top of which i generously added an extra 50000 so as not to be insulting
4,2,walter,20 million
4,2,badger,okay mr
4,2,lawson,wolynetz this this is the price for walter white
4,2,mike,oh yes
4,2,lawson,you dont think i know who you are
4,2,lawson,i remember
4,2,lawson,well i have not pretended to be any your husband he quit without giving me notice
4,2,skinny pete,he broke my air fresheners
4,2,lawson,he cursed at me and grabbed himself
4,2,lawson,and now he wants to buy my car wash
4,2,lawson,but hes not man enough to come in here and face me himself
4,2,walter,instead he sends his woman
4,2,walter,excuse me
4,2,walter,walter white wants to buy my car wash
4,2,lawson,the price he pays is 20 million
4,2,skinny pete,now please leave
4,2,lawson,have you recently lost a loved one on an aviation disaster
4,2,lawson,have you suffered injury shock to the senses or property damage as a result of airplane debris or god forbid falling body parts
4,2,skinny pete,then call me saul goodman
4,2,lawson,it goes without saying that the six seven perhaps even eightfigure cash settlement that i can win for you will never fill the hole in your heart caused by your tragic loss but you deserve justice
4,2,lawson,so if you want to tip the scales back in your favor better call saul
4,2,mike,saul goodman attorney at law
4,2,walter,se habla español
4,2,mike,you might want to learn how to tail better if youre planning on making a habit of it
4,2,walter,may i buy you a drink

4,2,mike,why not
4,2,mike,you make a hell of a lot more than i do
4,2,walter,uh another round for him and ill have the same
4,2,walter,no ice
4,2,walter,i feel like i need to explain myself
4,2,walter,there were some actions that i took which i want you to understand
4,2,walter,i didnt want any of this to happen
4,2,walter,everything i did i did out of loyalty to my partner and then later of course it was purely out of selfdefense
4,2,walter,i hope you can appreciate that just like i appreciated that uh i appreciate that when you were going to kll me you were simply following orders
4,2,walter,i get that completely
4,2,walter,and i harbor no ill will
4,2,mike,well theres a load off my mind

4,2,walter,next week
4,2,lawson,are we cool
4,2,lawson,we are cool
4,3,saul,wipe down this
4,3,sketchy,i heard you broke new ground today
4,3,saul,i walked 16 feet in 20 minutes
4,3,marie,yeah i guess i broke new ground
4,3,sketchy,you worked here four years
4,3,sketchy,its a story people would believe
4,3,saul,this is what we buy
4,3,hank,slow down
4,3,marie,oh god
4,3,sketchy,at the first opportunity gus will kll us
4,3,sketchy,how does it look
4,3,sketchy,you mean in do i see it
4,3,sketchy,do you see it
4,3,sketchy,basically any lawman worth his salts going to spot that yeah
4,3,sketchy,assuming thats a deal breaker
4,3,sketchy,its a deal breaker
4,3,sketchy,well if stealth is what youre aspiring to you best go with something more compact
4,3,sketchy,38 special snub nose
4,3,sketchy,got a concealed hammer so it doesnt catch on your belt when you draw
4,3,sketchy,tried and true no nonsense about it
4,3,saul,five shts
4,3,jesse,yep
4,3,sketchy,atmatic has how many
4,3,sketchy,ten in the mag one in the chamber
4,3,sketchy,if you cant get it done with five then youre into spraying prey in which case i wouldnt count on another six closing the deal
4,3,sketchy,you load that with 158 grain hollow points instead of your standard wad cutters
4,3,marie,its got plenty of stopping power
4,3,sketchy,cant get more dependable than a wheel gn
4,3,saul,here
4,3,sketchy,um try it on with this
4,3,sketchy,that snub youll conceal real nice if you carry it iwb
4,3,sketchy,little harder to draw from but theres really no substitute if youre intent of fooling a vigilant eye
4,3,marie,comes in polymer too
4,3,sketchy,i prefer the feel of leather
4,3,skyler,old school i guess
4,3,sketchy,yeah um you sure its on the correct side
4,3,sketchy,if youre righthanded it is
4,3,sketchy,i dont know ma are you sure because maybe itll feel better on the left side
4,3,sketchy,general rule you dont want to cross draw not unless youre going to be sitting you know store clerks card gamers and such
4,3,sketchy,either way youre going to want to practice your draw a lot because if youre all fingers well it might could be him keeping a piece instead of you
4,3,walter,catch my drift
4,3,saul,whats this
4,3,sketchy,that there is why youre going to pay me five times what youd pay your neighborhood gn store
4,3,sketchy,serial number has been filed off
4,3,sketchy,so to state the obvious i dont want to be caught with this on me
4,3,sketchy,no sir to state the obvious you dont
4,3,sketchy,you know mister ive been providing my services for the past 30odd years
4,3,sketchy,youd think in that time id learn better than to ask a man his business especially about one referred by the lawyer but i do feel the urge to ask you we strictly talking defense here
4,3,sketchy,yes absolutely defense
4,3,walter,why
4,3,sketchy,because if its just personal protection aside from a bucket of money youd save yourself a potential felony twospot for carrying a wapon with a defaced serial number if youd just buy it legally
4,3,sketchy,yeah but if you did have to use it wouldnt it still be better to use one that couldnt be traced
4,3,sketchy,this is the west boss
4,3,sketchy,new mexicos not a retreat jurisdiction
4,3,marie,man steps to you bent on doing bodily harm youve got every right to plant your feet and sht to kll
4,3,sketchy,some call it a moral right and i do include myself within that class
4,3,sketchy,all this to say im happy to take your money but if youre not a convicted felon you might best be advised to bear your arms within the confines of the law
4,3,sketchy,its for defense
4,3,walter,defense
4,3,saul,ill take it
4,3,marie,thanks bonnie
4,3,marie,jesse
4,3,sketchy,whats up brother
4,3,sketchy,dude it sounds like an earthquake out there
4,3,saul,yeah

4,3,jesse,check it out
4,3,sketchy,bodacious subwoofers yo
4,3,sketchy,serious cannons

4,3,sketchy,aluminum columns so theyre really really like uh sonically neutral
4,3,marie,tweeters are kllers too
4,3,sketchy,dig all them lines jumping around
4,3,sketchy,psychedelic
4,3,sketchy,kind of like just want to stare at them
4,3,saul,yeah man
4,3,sketchy,totally makes me want to crank old savage and blaze one
4,3,marie,its got like parametric equalization
4,3,sketchy,automatically adjusts the levels to changes in like air pressure and whatnot
4,3,sketchy,its a totally digital vacuum tube amp which is by far the best antidistortionwise
4,3,sketchy,its 120 decibels without breaking a sweat
4,3,sketchy,hold on to your hats btches
4,3,sketchy,hey man i saw andrea at a meeting yesterday

4,3,sketchy,aw please brother youre fronting
4,3,saul,no man seriously

4,3,sketchy,talk about inspiring a brother to kick some zombie ass
4,3,sketchy,theyre trying to eat your brain bro
4,3,saul,a dude dont need no more motivation
4,3,marie,thats a fair point i guess
4,3,saul,okay
4,3,saul,okay
4,3,saul,okay
4,3,sketchy,call of duty world at wr zombie mode

4,3,saul,i do
4,3,marie,and i am prepared to talk numbers right now if youd like
4,3,sketchy,do you think this is an easy job
4,3,sketchy,you are willing to get down on your hands and knees and scrub like a house maid with all the chemicals eating into your nice skin and stinging in your eyes
4,3,sketchy,well i know a thing or two about scrubbing
4,3,sketchy,any other advice for me
4,3,sketchy,because i am serious about this
4,3,cop,good
4,3,marie,i am serious too
4,3,sketchy,i have worked 30 years of building this business from nothing with my own hands and my own sweat and blood
4,3,saul,i can appreciate that truly
4,3,sketchy,so with that in mind is there a figure you can quote me
4,3,sketchy,one which you think would adequately 10 million
4,3,saul,well lets try 879000
4,3,sketchy,where do you come up with this number
4,3,sketchy,you pull it from your behind
4,3,sketchy,on a typical day you manage 19 cars per hour
4,3,sketchy,extrapolating i added the extra revenues for hand waxes and detailing subtracted your overhead and salary and maintenance operating fees depreciation which i obtained from comparable businesses in the albuquerque area giving me an estimate of your annual cash flow here to which i applied the industry standard multiplier and added the market value of your real estate giving me a total estimated value of 829000 on top of which i generously added an extra 50000 so as not to be insulting
4,3,saul,20 million
4,3,saul,okay mr
4,3,sketchy,wolynetz this this is the price for walter white
4,3,sketchy,you dont think i know who you are

4,3,sketchy,he broke my air fresheners
4,3,sketchy,he cursed at me and grabbed himself
4,3,sketchy,and now he wants to buy my car wash
4,3,marie,but hes not man enough to come in here and face me himself
4,3,saul,instead he sends his woman
4,3,sketchy,excuse me
4,3,sketchy,walter white wants to buy my car wash
4,3,sketchy,the price he pays is 20 million
4,3,jesse,now please leave
4,3,sketchy,have you recently lost a loved one on an aviation disaster
4,3,sketchy,have you suffered injury shock to the senses or property damage as a result of airplane debris or god forbid falling body parts
4,3,sketchy,then call me saul goodman
4,3,sketchy,it goes without saying that the six seven perhaps even eightfigure cash settlement that i can win for you will never fill the hole in your heart caused by your tragic loss but you deserve justice

4,3,sketchy,saul goodman attorney at law

4,3,marie,i didnt want any of this to happen
4,3,sketchy,everything i did i did out of loyalty to my partner and then later of course it was purely out of selfdefense
4,3,sketchy,i hope you can appreciate that just like i appreciated that uh i appreciate that when you were going to kll me you were simply following orders

4,4,sketchy,i made a copy for you in case youre interested
4,4,jesse,it pertains to some methamphetamine superlab
4,4,mike,money
4,4,sketchy,what are we saying is the source of this money
4,4,sketchy,walt came up with a story about gambling winnings
4,4,jesse,blackjack right
4,4,walter,some card counting
4,4,sketchy,actually that was skylers idea
4,4,sketchy,i think you are behind all this
4,4,sketchy,when the others find out what youve done maybe we come pay you a visit
4,4,skyler,ándale
4,4,sketchy,mueve el culo cabrón
4,4,skyler,ándale
4,4,sketchy,did you want me to open the doors
4,4,skyler,qué estás haciendo
4,4,hank,here
4,4,sketchy,the keys
4,4,sketchy,take them
4,4,sketchy,por qué me estás hablando en inglés
4,4,sketchy,why you talk english huh
4,4,mike,no no no
4,4,sketchy,ohh ahh gambling destroyed my life me my family everything i loved
4,4,sketchy,it was like a robbery only i was the thief
4,4,sketchy,its amazing the stories you tell yourself to justify it the lies that lead you to just one more hand one more spin one more roll of the dice
4,4,sketchy,this is our deal okay
4,4,mike,marie no
4,4,sketchy,you guys are not lifting a finger
4,4,sketchy,i mean it
4,4,sketchy,yeah were bringing everything so this this is not up for debate okay
4,4,skyler,great
4,4,walter,now sweetie dont worry okay
4,4,sketchy,were not going to say one word about the bills
4,4,sketchy,we just want to bring everyone up to speed okay
4,4,jesse,all right
4,4,sketchy,ill see you soon
4,4,sketchy,so tonights the night
4,4,sketchy,no turning back
4,4,sketchy,well okay
4,4,sketchy,lets do this
4,4,sketchy,okay so first i assign point values correlate to the effect of removal
4,4,sketchy,you going to split the 8s
4,4,jesse,skyler please
4,4,sketchy,now the mathematical principle known as the kelly criterion upon which i devised my own strategy not dissimilar to the mit system
4,4,sketchy,walt youre not teaching them
4,4,sketchy,i thought you wanted me to be thorough
4,4,skyler,just play
4,4,sketchy,youre taking too long
4,4,sketchy,what you dont think it behooves me to be able to explain any of this
4,4,sketchy,it behooves you to be a pro thats all im saying
4,4,sketchy,thats the fiction so chopchop
4,4,skyler,dont chopchop me
4,4,skyler,walt
4,4,sketchy,now we both know that the first decision is whether or not to split or surrender on 8s
4,4,sketchy,split em
4,4,sketchy,good on both
4,4,sketchy,next decision is whether to double down or not
4,4,sketchy,what you should be doing
4,4,sketchy,on 11 yes
4,4,jesse,double
4,4,sketchy,okay this hand over here we have a soft 18
4,4,sketchy,the final decision is whether or not is to hit or to stand
4,4,sketchy,hit it
4,4,sketchy,becomes a hard 15
4,4,sketchy,dealer has a 9
4,4,sketchy,i see that
4,4,sketchy,hit it
4,4,sketchy,okay lets see what i got
4,4,sketchy,and 21
4,4,jesse,yep
4,4,sketchy,okay this the key thing to remember here is that its not about any one hand
4,4,sketchy,the key is the number of hands per hour
4,4,jesse,lets go again
4,4,sketchy,zero minus 1
4,4,skyler,walt
4,4,sketchy,its not as if i dont know how to play
4,4,sketchy,i certainly more than understand how to count cards
4,4,skyler,lets just keep going okay
4,4,sketchy,no you know what
4,4,walter,im in recovery
4,4,sketchy,i shouldnt even be playing
4,4,sketchy,and that is the fiction that we should be sticking to
4,4,sketchy,you know what
4,4,jesse,youre right
4,4,skyler,yeah
4,4,sketchy,um were not leaving anything to chance
4,4,sketchy,all right lets get started
4,4,sketchy,ive got a lot of uh walt weve got a lot of ground to cover
4,4,sketchy,what is this
4,4,sketchy,we have to get our stories straight
4,4,sketchy,weve got to be on the same page
4,4,sketchy,is this a script
4,4,walter,bllet points
4,4,walter,bllet points
4,4,jesse,like a novella
4,4,skyler,this is smart
4,4,sketchy,you really want to try to sell a dea agent some illprepared halfassed fullofholes story about how we suddenly have enough money to buy a car wash
4,4,sketchy,am i supposed to memorize this
4,4,sketchy,we need to practice walt
4,4,skyler,yeah
4,4,sketchy,we need to be wordperfect
4,4,mike,within reason
4,4,sketchy,we need this story to be solid and sympathetic and most of all completely believable
4,4,sketchy,from a story that you already told marie and you think that she hasnt told hank
4,4,jesse,come on
4,4,sketchy,this is marie were talking about here
4,4,walter,no she hasnt
4,4,walter,she hasnt
4,4,sketchy,hank thinks his insurance is paying for everything
4,4,sketchy,maries not telling him that were paying his therapy bills and neither are we
4,4,sketchy,and why is that again
4,4,skyler,really
4,4,sketchy,if we have the gambling story did you take money walt
4,4,sketchy,you remember gretchen and elliot
4,4,sketchy,because i seem to recall that youd rather sell drgs than take help
4,4,walter,fine
4,4,sketchy,marie will tell hank in her own time and at least well have laid the groundwork
4,4,sketchy,and coming clean with hank and jun appearing to come clean will be the best thing for everyone
4,4,sketchy,we talked about this okay
4,4,sketchy,we agreed about this
4,4,skyler,yes we did
4,4,skyler,its just what
4,4,walter,never mind
4,4,walter,just okay
4,4,sketchy,so i really think we should tag team the narrative okay
4,4,sketchy,well each be responsible for certain portions of the story and then we can uh we can hand off so we dont leave anything out and itll seem the most natural
4,4,sketchy,okay so im going to launch with the exciting news that we are buying a car wash yay
4,4,sketchy,the next logical question hank will probably ask is where are you getting the money
4,4,walter, hmm
4,4,sketchy,to which ill say we want to tell you the whole story
4,4,sketchy,its a doozy so hold on to your hats
4,4,sketchy, do you like that
4,4,mike,sure
4,4,sketchy,it accomplishes two things
4,4,sketchy,it keeps it light while letting them know to expect something big
4,4,skyler,yeah
4,4,sketchy,its a doozy
4,4,sketchy,anyway thats where you will take over starting with your diagnosis pages 1 and 2
4,4,sketchy,okay and its its pretty much going to run parallel to the truth which makes it easier but um just make sure to really hit the cancer really touch on the fear and despair
4,4,sketchy,its good to remind them and to get their sympathy right off the bat
4,4,sketchy,we want them to understand why you could do something so stupid
4,4,sketchy,now after that per pages 3 and 4 after you say gambling became an addiction and i just couldnt control it
4,4,sketchy, do you see that yes
4,4,sketchy,right there in the middle of the page
4,4,sketchy,oh and i put in that line about robbery
4,4,sketchy,you know from the g
4,4,walter,meeting
4,4,sketchy,i thought that was good
4,4,sketchy,so next ill chime in about how it affected our marriage uh starting with the uh the deceit why we couldnt tell anyone
4,4,walter,terribly terribly ashamed of my actions
4,4,skyler, yeah
4,4,walter,theres two terriblys
4,4,skyler,its supposed to show contrition
4,4,sketchy,well i just wouldnt use that word
4,4,sketchy,i would never say the word terribly
4,4,sketchy, phrase it however you want okay
4,4,skyler,youre jumping ahead
4,4,walter,now and why why am i so ashamed
4,4,skyler,do i really need to answer that
4,4,walter,i was and am providing for our family
4,4,skyler,lets just pick up where we left off
4,4,walter,im weak and im out of control
4,4,walter,i mean this whole thing makes me look like crap
4,4,skyler,this has to be a wartsandall story walt
4,4,skyler,thats how well sell it and we both look bad
4,4,walter,oh well how do you look bad exactly
4,4,walter,where is the i slept with my boss bllet point
4,4,sketchy,i cant seem to find that anywhere
4,4,skyler,for a fired schoolteacher who cooks crystal meth id say youre coming out pretty much ahead
4,4,jesse,i dont like it
4,4,sketchy,i dont want junior thinking less of me
4,4,sketchy,at least you won at gambling
4,4,sketchy,im just the btch mom who wouldnt cut you any slack
4,4,jesse,im sorry
4,4,sketchy,im sorry that i put you through all of this
4,4,sketchy,hows that sound
4,4,hank,here
4,4,walter,two sorrys
4,4,sketchy, i believe we were on page 5
4,4,sketchy,so after you say how very sorry you are in your own words of course were almost to the end and i say how proud i am of you for joining a 12step program and and this is where i think we should enact how were feeling you know
4,4,walter,just a just a suggestion
4,4,sketchy,you might look down on the floor with remorse
4,4,jesse,what
4,4,sketchy,you dont have to mean it
4,4,sketchy,you just stare down at your feet walt okay
4,4,sketchy,then uh im gonna i was thinking of taking maries hand and saying something emotional like its such a relief to tell you
4,4,sketchy,were just so glad we have a strong family to help us through this that we can all support each other
4,4,sketchy, and then maybe ill tear up a little
4,4,jesse,i dont know
4,4,sketchy,ill just have to see what happens in the moment
4,4,sketchy,youre going to cry
4,4,walter,on cue
4,4,jesse,i said i dont know
4,4,sketchy,when you dab your eyes you going to do it with your right hand or your left
4,4,sketchy,its just an idea
4,4,jesse,one tear
4,4,walter,two tears
4,4,sketchy,this has to be convincing especially to hank
4,4,sketchy,im doing the best i can here walt
4,4,sketchy,and yes im thorough
4,4,sketchy,maybe lying doesnt come as easily to me as it does to you
4,4,sketchy,hey
4,4,mike,guys
4,4,walter,come on in
4,4,sketchy,good to see you
4,4,sketchy,hey

4,4,sketchy,now that one there thats rhodonite okay
4,4,sketchy,its manganese inosilicate
4,4,skyler,cool
4,4,sketchy,what what makes it be all pink like that
4,4,sketchy,well thats the manganese part okay
4,4,sketchy,it it oxidizes you know like rust
4,4,walter,exactly
4,4,sketchy,manganese can have an oxidation state of between 3 and 7 which takes it through a range of colors purple green blue
4,4,sketchy,but its most stable state is 2 which is usually pale pink
4,4,walter,so exactly
4,4,sketchy,whatever the hell he said
4,4,sketchy,anyway you uh you get the idea

4,4,sketchy,jesus
4,4,walter,let go of me
4,4,sketchy,gales mrder is being investigated
4,4,jesse,uh duh
4,4,sketchy,and i have it on good authority that they found fingerprints at the scene
4,4,jesse,not mine
4,4,hank,we done here
4,4,hank,no we are not done here
4,4,sketchy,what if they are yours
4,4,sketchy,how can you be so sure
4,4,sketchy,because im here all right
4,4,sketchy,your brotherinlaws got such a hardon for me that if the cops would have found my fingerprints shh
4,4,sketchy,the cops would have found my fingerprints within five blocks of that place they would have picked me up by now
4,4,sketchy,what about the casing
4,4,sketchy,or casings
4,4,sketchy,how how many times did you sht him anyway
4,4,sketchy,jesse did you pick up the casings
4,4,sketchy,did you pick them up
4,4,sketchy,listen uh weve got to go over this step by step everything
4,4,sketchy,i want you to tell me exactly what happened from the moment you got there
4,4,walter,i got in i got out
4,4,sketchy,no i need to know specifics
4,4,sketchy,now well start from the beginning
4,4,sketchy,you you drove there
4,4,sketchy,you drove over there
4,4,sketchy,you went to his door right
4,4,sketchy,jesse i need you to concentrate
4,4,skyler,this is very important
4,4,sketchy,did you knock or ring
4,4,sketchy,knock or ring
4,4,jesse,knock
4,4,hank,okay good
4,4,walter,thats very good
4,4,jesse,now listen
4,4,sketchy,i assume that gale answered the door
4,4,sketchy,now what happened after that
4,4,sketchy,did he recognize you
4,4,sketchy,did you say anything to each other
4,4,sketchy,did you walk into the room or did you sht him right then and there
4,4,jesse,what
4,4,sketchy,who wants to make a hundred bucks
4,4,sketchy,look the kids probably right
4,4,sketchy,if they had anything on him hed be locked up already
4,4,sketchy,what about my brotherinlaw
4,4,sketchy,he suspects jess hell he knows jesse is involved in the sale of blue meth
4,4,sketchy,that was hanks one and only lead
4,4,sketchy,now what if he puts and he goes after jesse for the mrder
4,4,sketchy,he goes after him how on his rascal scooter
4,4,skyler,ahem
4,4,walter,that perhaps sounded insensitive
4,4,sketchy,uh but if he goes after him ill sue his ass for police brutality harassment asault and 16 other things
4,4,sketchy,now the history that those two have together being what it is you got to figure your brotherinlaws smart enough not to go down that particular road
4,4,sketchy,goose egg bupkis thats what the cops got
4,4,walter,i wouldnt worry about it
4,4,walter,what else should i not worry about saul hmm
4,4,walter,should i not worry that gus plans to mrder me at the first chance he gets
4,4,walter,should i not worry that my drugaddicted partner doesnt seem to care whether he lives or dies
4,4,walter,you should see his house
4,4,walter,its its like skid row
4,4,sketchy,he has actual hobos living there
4,4,walter,now how long before gus decides that hes too big of a risk
4,4,sketchy,geez that mike that grunting deadeyed cretin suckerpunching me in the in the face
4,4,walter,ive got gus wielding a box cutter
4,4,walter,i mean western union message received
4,4,sketchy,it let me ask you
4,4,walter,when did this stop being a business hmm
4,4,walter,why am i the only person capable of behaving in a professional manner
4,4,sketchy,no i no any way you slice it everyones in danger
4,4,sketchy,i mean how how can i protect anyone
4,4,walter,my family jesse myself
4,4,sketchy,my name never comes up with those guys does it
4,4,sketchy,meanwhile were buying this stupid car wash
4,4,skyler,yeah
4,4,sketchy,that ship has sailed
4,4,sketchy,bon voyage
4,4,skyler,we are committed
4,4,sketchy,we already told our family about it and now skyler im sure she believes she needs to believe that everything is neat and tidy and shes telling herself that i work in this nice quiet little lab with a white lab coat and a pocket protector and when my contract is up ill just simply hang it all up tip my hat and walk away
4,4,walter,oh god
4,4,sketchy,how did everything get so screwed up
4,4,sketchy,yeah you do have a little shit creek action happening
4,4,sketchy,you know fyi you can buy a paddle
4,4,sketchy,this is a last resort back pocket kind of thing but if you really got to protect yourself uhdisappear
4,4,sketchy,theres a guy who can make it happen
4,4,jesse,call him a uh disappearer
4,4,sketchy,for a substantial fee and i do mean substantial you and your loved ones can vanish untraceable
4,4,sketchy,i mean he sets you up with a whole new life
4,4,sketchy,what like a witness protection kind of thing
4,4,sketchy,i mean off the grid
4,4,sketchy,new identities new everything
4,4,sketchy,no one would ever be able to trace you
4,4,sketchy,now be clear this is an end game if you get my meaning
4,4,sketchy,i mean theres no coming back
4,4,sketchy,sh you want his card
4,4,sketchy,god theres got to be something else that i could do
4,4,sketchy,some way to keep everything from spiraling out of control
4,4,sketchy,well i mean from what you told me it sounds like uh pinkman is first up in the imminent demise department
4,4,sketchy,gus wont risk letting the police find jesse
4,4,jesse,i know him
4,4,walter,he wont
4,4,sketchy,im not even kidding because if you really think about it you cant even see it so how can you know just how bad radio frequencies and microwaves and cell phones and stuff are getting you
4,4,sketchy,i mean you could be strolling through security at the airport on the way to visit your grandma or wake up btches
4,4,sketchy,and then you get waved through a fullbody xray scanner and the next day you could be dead or dying from all the radiation that they say is safe but theres no way
4,4,sketchy,it could be because they have to deliver a concentrated dose okay
4,4,sketchy,enough to penetrate through clothes and so the accumulated amount could definitely be dangerous to susceptible individuals hey yo
4,4,sketchy,especially if youre from a rural area and the ozone layers already thin yo
4,4,sketchy,because of the cow farts
4,4,hank,oh hey
4,4,sketchy,will you make sure theres pizza here when i get back
4,4,sketchy,enough for everybody
4,4,skyler,oh yeah
4,4,sketchy,i can do that
4,4,sketchy,i can definitely do that
4,4,jesse,all right
4,4,jesse,not a problem all right
4,4,sketchy,i can get the stuff the pizza and stuff but as as far as the financial situation you know
4,4,sketchy,just hang on hang on
4,4,skyler,oh yeah
4,4,sketchy,you know and you know if theres a concentrated dose its really its gonna its gonna play hob with your bone marrow and its really gonna mess up because because because especially if you have cancer and you know because if you got to get a bone marrow transplant your odds are are 60
4,4,sketchy,you have a 60 chance
4,4,sketchy,hey
4,4,sketchy,hey
4,4,sketchy,hey
4,4,sketchy,get some dipping sticks too yo
4,4,sketchy,uh i can i can definitely get dipping sticks

4,5,walter,questions
4,5,walter,more than a few yeah
4,5,walter,but i know better than to ask
4,5,jesse,anyway it was like you wanted
4,5,jesse,the kids a hero
4,5,walter,poopoopoopoopoo just the idea of owning a car wash seems daunting but i had to warn myself who is just the most beautiful little girl in the world
4,5,jesse,i think its you
4,5,walter,so coming into a business like this thats up and running fully operational puts us way ahead of the game
4,5,walter,you know were still going to have some change over time i think its you
4,5,mike,yeah i do
4,5,mike,but we do have a staff in place so you know luckily well be able to hold on to most of bogdans employees
4,5,walter,we might lose a few to the ultra wash across town though
4,5,walter,theyre making a grab i hear
4,5,jesse,you going to put the kid to work
4,5,mike,i got school
4,5,walter,im not talking about you
4,5,mike,im talking about your baby sister
4,5,mike,i wouldnt let you near my car
4,5,walter,hey thats not a bad idea you guys
4,5,mike,you should put holly on the sign
4,5,jesse,like a mascot
4,5,walter,like the gerber baby
4,5,walter,i would get my car washed there every day if i saw her face out front
4,5,walter,what about me
4,5,walter,the goal is to bring customers in not scare them away so walt theres another bottle in the kitchen
4,5,mike,just help yourself
4,5,hank,good
4,5,walter,uh maybe we could roll uncle hank through the car wash
4,5,mike,he could be the first customer
4,5,mike,the wipedown crew would clean you up good
4,5,walter,see this son
4,5,mike,i got your wipedown right here pal
4,5,walter,hank can you just maybe get through one meal without you saying something disgusting
4,5,mike,so what are you going to do with holly all day
4,5,jesse,you cant take her to work with all those chemicals and migrants hanging around
4,5,mike,marie what
4,5,walter,that cant be safe
4,5,mike,fortunately there is just five minutes away from the car wash there is the top child care center in the city
4,5,walter,the national child care association gives it really high ratings so thats quite a relief and you know its just a walk away if we need it
4,5,walter,i got to tell you im just im really really impressed
4,5,walter,i mean you came together on this and im really happy that its working out for you
4,5,walter,thanks
4,5,jesse,it was a little scary but it uh needed to be done
4,5,mike,and uh we get possession of the keys tomorrow
4,5,walter,oh thats awesome
4,5,walter,i cant wait to see what kind of car ill get for my birthday now with all this money rolling in
4,5,mike,i think youve been spending too much time around your uncle hank
4,5,mike,the squeaky wheel gets the grease
4,5,jesse,right uncle hank
4,5,jesse,squeaky and greasy
4,5,walter,thats you my friend
4,5,mike,hey uh nick the greek you going to share that bottle or what
4,5,walter,whos nick the greek
4,5,mike,nick the greek
4,5,hank,he was a famous bigtime card player
4,5,walter,hank thats not funny
4,5,walter,what
4,5,hank,its a compliment
4,5,walter,well thats even worse then
4,5,jesse,youre giving positive reinforcement to behavior that walt is working very very hard to change
4,5,jesse,right skyler
4,5,walter,i dont see how its bad dad just raking in the beaucoup bucks now
4,5,walter,you know i just uh think maybe we could change the subject
4,5,mike,sure

4,5,walter,absolutely
4,5,walter,hey uncle hank what about that case you were looking at with that crazy singing guy
4,5,walter,ah im off that
4,5,jesse,i i gave my assessment to the apd and im done
4,5,walter,the case of the crazy singing guy
4,5,walter,sounds like an encyclopedia brown story doesnt it
4,5,walter,crazy is is is uh is the wrong word
4,5,hank,this guy gale boetticher he was uh he was eccentric
4,5,hank,i mean a real character you know
4,5,hank,hes uh hes dead now you know
4,5,skyler,who was he
4,5,walter jr,he was a meth cook
4,5,hank,uh he was a meth chef
4,5,hank,i mean were talking five stars candles and white tablecloths
4,5,hank,hey i cant believe these words are gonna come out of my mouth but he was a genius plain and simple
4,5,hank,i mean uh boy if you applied that big brain of his to something good i dont know who knows what could have helped humanity or something like that you know
4,5,hank,i mean how many actual geniuses are there in the world right
4,5,hank,if hed kind of taken his life in a different direction who knows
4,5,walter,hank not to tell you your business but im not sure i agree
4,5,mike,what do you mean
4,5,walter,well i mean you showed me that notebook and from what i saw and this is just my humble opinion from what i saw on those papers genius
4,5,walter,not so much
4,5,walter,i mean there was no reasoning no deductions in those pages
4,5,walter,to my eye all this brilliance looks like nothing more than just simple rote copying probably of someone elses work
4,5,walter,believe me ive been around enough students to know
4,5,walter,ah this genius of yours maybe hes still out there
4,5,walter,hank
4,5,walter jr,hey babe
4,5,jesse,uh tim stopped by
4,5,walter,he brought over some file boxes on that case
4,5,walter,thought id take another peek

4,6,walter,its a story people would believe
4,6,walter,this is what we buy
4,6,walter,to clean cars and clean money
4,6,walter,gale boetticher he was a genius
4,6,jesse,im not sure i agree
4,6,walter,what do you mean
4,6,walter,this genius of yours maybe is still out there
4,6,walter,no no no
4,6,jesse,hey
4,6,walter,uh it its me

4,6,walter,the firewall all right
4,6,walter,church and state

4,6,walter,and then i remembered the message you left me the other day when you said you loved me
4,6,walter,after last night i walt i think youre scared
4,6,walter,i think that message was some kind of goodbye

4,7,hank,and gus fring
4,7,walter,just winging that guy is not gonna ameliorate your situation not by a damn sight
4,7,hank,i tried to but i cant get anywhere near him

4,7,walter,he said he sees things in people
4,7,walter,what things
4,7,walter,what people
4,7,jesse,he said he sees something in me
4,7,walter,a month ago gus was trying to kll both of us and now he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as what an assistant gunman
4,7,walter,a tough guy
4,7,walter,does that make any sense to you
4,7,walter,he says he sees something in you
4,7,walter,what kind of game is he playing
4,7,walter,does he think youre that naive
4,7,walter,he cant truly think that youd forget well let alone gale let alone victor and all the horror that goes along with all of that
4,7,walter,what about this girlfriend of yours and her little brother
4,7,walter,the man looked you straight in the eye and told you no more children but that very night that little boy he winds up gus cant possibly think that youd forget that
4,7,jesse,okay

4,7,jesse,drop the sales pitch
4,7,jesse,ill do it
4,7,walter,youll do what
4,7,jesse,ill kll him first chance i get
4,7,gomez,pia colada
4,7,walter,more like stale bubblegum
4,7,walter,does anyone actually want their car to smell like the bottom of a sixthgraders desk
4,7,jesse,okay
4,7,walter,hemp
4,7,merkert,really
4,7,walter,but you know what they say the customers always right
4,7,hank,speaking of customer its not too late to have a grand opening
4,7,walter,i was thinking huge party balloons bouncy house for the kids you know make a splash get on tv
4,7,hank,let people know theyre not gonna have to face the eyebrows of doom when they come in
4,7,hank,marie hows hank doing
4,7,jesse,you know what
4,7,hank,hes doing better
4,7,merkert,really

4,7,hank,bogdan was averaging and we are already up to 22 lat night i deposited 3800
4,7,walter,how much is that
4,7,walter,give or take
4,7,walter,give or take
4,7,walter, yeah
4,7,mike,i havent counted it
4,7,hank,wait and this is how often
4,7,walter,every two weeks
4,7,walter,thursdays good for a dropoff
4,7,walter,wait walt
4,7,jesse,are you telling me you make 7125000 a year
4,7,walter,before expenses
4,7,hank,but i cant this is too much
4,7,walter,so its more than you thought and this is somehow bad news
4,7,walter,no thats not the point
4,7,walter,i mean there is no car wash in the world that could do this kind of business
4,7,walter,i mean this is 9 months work here minimum
4,7,walter,that could take years
4,7,walter,so set some aside
4,7,mike,save it for a rainy day
4,7,jesse,what save it where
4,7,walter,i cant go to the bank with it
4,7,walter,i sure cant leave it here
4,7,walter,ohh oi
4,7,walter,wait a minute
4,7,walter,is this all 50s
4,7,walter,who pays for a car wash with a 50
4,7,walter,skyler i didnt ask you to do this
4,7,walter,i was under the impression that you had this under control
4,7,walter,i just didnt expect this amount of money
4,7,hank,the 50s are gonna be a problem
4,7,walter,well thats what this is problem solving
4,7,walter,skyler this is a simple division of labor
4,7,walter,i bring in the money you launder the money
4,7,walter,this is what you wanted
4,7,walter,i never wanted any of this
4,7,hank,ive got to go
4,7,walter,if you want out just say that you want out
4,7,walter,okay then
4,7,walter,youre telling me you made this in the lab
4,7,walter,why not
4,7,hank,making it in his own lab seemed appropriate
4,7,walter,theres not much of it
4,7,walter,we had more for tuco
4,7,walter,its enough
4,7,walter,this is still the best way
4,7,walter,you go after him with a gn youll never get out of it alive
4,7,walter,but with this you slip it into his food or drink there shouldnt be any taste or smell a man his age working as hard as he does no one will be surprised
4,7,walter,what about mike
4,7,walter,mike can have his suspicions but thats all theyll be
4,7,walter,please one homicidal maniac at a time

4,7,walter,so the truth is we cant change the past
4,7,hank,whats done is done
4,7,walter,weve got to own our actions but putting ourselves on trial acting as our own judge jury and executioner its not the answer because a lot of the time all that judging does is just ensure that were going to repeat the cycle
4,7,walter,right
4,7,walter,im such an asshhole
4,7,hank, its totally hopeless
4,7,walter, whats the point

4,7,walter,he was suffering
4,7,walter,it was a kindness
4,7,walter,no he wasnt sick
4,7,jesse,no he was just like a i dont know like a problem dog
4,7,walter,what did he do

4,7,walter,well what was the problem
4,7,jesse,why did you have to kll him
4,7,walter,watch the crosstalk please
4,7,walter,maybe its not the details that matter
4,7,walter,right
4,7,jesse,howd you feel about what you did jesse
4,7,hank,i dont know
4,7,jesse,who cares how you feel
4,7,walter,what kind of a person kills a dog for no reason
4,7,walter,colleen
4,7,walter,you put an ad in the paper
4,7,walter,you drop him off at a shelter
4,7,hank,colleen  you just dont sit there and talk about klling a helpless  colleen
4,7,walter,innocent animal
4,7,hank,were not here to sit in judgment
4,7,walter,why not
4,7,walter,why not
4,7,hank,maybe maybe shes right
4,7,walter,you know maybe i should have put it in the paper
4,7,hank,maybe i should have done something different
4,7,jesse,the thing is if you just do stuff and nothing happens whats it all mean
4,7,walter,whats the point
4,7,jesse,all right this whole thing is about selfacceptance
4,7,jesse,so i should stop judging  and accept  its a start
4,7,jesse,so no matter what i do hooray for me because im a great guy
4,7,walter,its all good
4,7,jesse,no matter how many dogs i kll i just what do an inventory and accept
4,7,jesse,i mean you back your truck over your own kid and you like accept

4,7,walter,hey better you than me buddy
4,7,hank,seriously congratulations buddy
4,7,walter,thanks
4,7,walter,steve said you might have something for us
4,7,hank,yeah maybe
4,7,hank,you guys are going to have to tell me
4,7,walter,remember my pal tim roberts
4,7,hank,apd detective
4,7,hank,yeah well hes working on a mrder case and the victims a 34yearold male caucasian by the name of gale boetticher
4,7,hank,one night last month boetticher opens the door bam take a bllet to the face from a person or persons unknown
4,7,hank,now this gale boetticher is a bona fide chemistry genius
4,7,hank,i mean hes got degrees up the wazoo right
4,7,walter,and uh as you might expect hes a nerds nerd
4,7,walter,vegan sandals and socks kind of guy
4,7,walter,as it turns out hes also an anumber 1 meth cook
4,7,hank,and what caught my eye is uh his specialty products blue
4,7,hank,so what are you thinking
4,7,walter,this is your heisenberg
4,7,hank,what i think we got here is uh ahem heisenbergs former cook and maybe a line on heisenberg himself
4,7,walter,anyway uh lo and behold amidst all the hippiedippie nonsense ahem i find this
4,7,hank,now this here i do a little googlefu and i i realize its a parts number specifically for this baby
4,7,walter,now that there is a highvolume hepa industrial air filtration system
4,7,walter,thats a 300000 gadget
4,7,walter,perfect for a pharmaceutical plant or microchip factory or maybe the biggest meth lab north of the border
4,7,jesse,okay
4,7,hank,so this little dingus here is manufactured by a big international concern madrigal electromotive
4,7,walter,i call their houston office and eventually i get through to the nicest little i use some of the schrader sweet talk on her
4,7,jesse,before you know it shes pulling files for me
4,7,walter,turns out six months ago one of these systems was shipped to a depot right here in abq
4,7,mike,who signed for it
4,7,hank,gale boetticher
4,7,walter,so i asked my new girlfriend who paid for it and she says nobody
4,7,walter, they have no record that anybody actually paid for this thing
4,7,hank,so i go back and push more and before you know it uh the temps gone theres no forwarding address and im talking to some snotnose corporate lawyer whos asking me for my badge number
4,7,walter,brick wall
4,7,jesse,so i take a peek into madrigal electromotive
4,7,walter,now madrigal is based in hanover germany but theyre what they call highly diversified industrial equipment global shipping major construction and a tiny little foothold in american fast food specifically a local chain pollos hermanos
4,7,jesse,okay
4,7,walter,so what right
4,7,hank,boettichers dead
4,7,hank,i got no line on whos been bankrolling him or where his lab was
4,7,jesse,the whole things a snipe hunt right
4,7,hank,but now i get this crazy idea and i cant shake it
4,7,hank,i mean i i stay up nights staring at the ceiling and trying to make sense of it
4,7,walter,its that napkin
4,7,walter,remember i told you boettichers vegan right
4,7,walter,i mean were talking this guy makes his own fermented lentil bread or whatever the hell that is
4,7,hank,whats a vegan doing in a fried chicken joint
4,7,gomez,maybe hes meeting somebody
4,7,jesse,like who
4,7,hank,well like maybe this guy
4,7,hank,i mean what do we know about gustavo fring
4,7,jesse,huh
4,7,hank,this whole friend of law enforcement thing eh could be a case of keep your friends close but your enemies closer
4,7,hank,hes got the money to finance this operation
4,7,hank,maybe hes got the connections too
4,7,hank,maybe just maybe hes our guy
4,7,merkert,hank no offense but i think youre really reaching
4,7,gomez,if your guy had his meeting at kfc you wouldnt immediately assume that hes sitting down with colonel sanders
4,7,hank,you know i ahem i couldnt agree more guys
4,7,hank,gustavo fring blue meth you know the whole thing is offthemap nuts
4,7,hank,i ought to be wearing a tinfoil hat you know
4,7,hank,except i cant seem to wrap my mind around this one little thing and that is what are gustavo frings fingerprints doing in gale boettichers apartment
4,8,walter,no now listen i uh this attack on my brotherinlaw i dont i dont know what it means
4,8,walter,please i fear for my family
4,8,walter,im sure theyll be fine
4,8,gus,i am told the assassin that survived is gravely injured
4,8,jesse,its doubtful hell live
4,8,walter,now thank me and shake my hand
4,8,walter,uh thank you
4,8,walter,thank you again
4,8,eladio,youre quite welcome mr
4,8,gus,white
4,8,walter,whats happening
4,8,gus,the time
4,8,walter,time of death 2043
4,8,walter,burn in hell you piece of shit
4,8,news reporter,one suspected gunman died at the scene
4,8,news reporter,the second succumbed to his wounds earlier this evening at an area hospital
4,8,news reporter,agents with the dea and fbi in conjunction with apd homicide detectives are working with mexican law enforcement in an attempt to identify deceased sospect
4,8,gus,i can give you highlights
4,8,gus,your nephews grew impatient
4,8,gus,they continue to press me for my permission to kll walter white
4,8,gus,when i wouldnt give it they settled instead for dea agent schrader
4,8,gus,their phone call was placed to agent schrader moments before the attack thus giving him the upper hand
4,8,gus,marco was shot in the face and died instantly
4,8,gus,leonel lingered for several hours
4,8,gus,the warning call to the dea agent juan bolsa may have some insight into who placed it
4,8,gus,but yesterday the federales were at his hacienda and in the confusion juan was shot dead
4,8,gus,an accident perhaps
4,8,gus,a mistake made by his own men though we may never know
4,8,gus,at any rate i thought you should hear from me
4,8,gus,this is what comes of blood for blood hector
4,8,gus,sangre por sangre
4,8,gus,so is this the loud one
4,8,walter,what
4,8,walter,i can never remember
4,8,gus,is this the loud machine with the magnets
4,8,gus,this is the petct scan
4,8,gus,positron emission tomography
4,8,news reporter,they pair that with the computed xray tomography
4,8,eladio,quiet
4,8,eladio,no magnets
4,8,gus,right
4,8,gus,yeah thanks
4,8,walter,im still pretty new at this
4,8,news reporter,my wife and i are thinking about having kids
4,8,jesse,walk into a doctors office and suddenly boom life as i know it excuse me
4,8,gus,yes
4,8,walter,im im waiting to hear a progress report on that thing we discussed
4,8,walter,so call me
4,8,gus,anyway so for me thats been the biggest wakeup call letting go giving up control
4,8,walter,that is such bullshit
4,8,walter,never give up control
4,8,walter,live life on your own terms
4,8,walter,ive been living with cancer for the better part of a year
4,8,walter,right from the start its a death sentence
4,8,walter,its what they keep telling me
4,8,walter,well guess what
4,8,walter,every life comes with a death sentence
4,8,walter,so every few months i come in here for my regular scan knowing full well that one of these times hell maybe even today im going to hear some bad news
4,8,walter,but until then whos in charge
4,8,walter,thats how i live my life
4,8,news reporter,this residue here is why we descale with cool water from the walkin and not water from the tap remember
4,8,eladio,do it again please
4,8,hank,pollos hermanos where something delicious is always cooking
4,8,news reporter,yes detective
4,8,walter,gustavo thanks for coming in
4,8,eladio,my pleasure
4,8,jesse,hows kathi
4,8,jesse,and you know hank schrader
4,8,gus,ah yes indeed
4,8,walter,and steve gomez
4,8,eladio,how was your meal
4,8,gus,agent schrader and i had a chance to catch up in one of my restaurants a few days ago
4,8,gus,id eat there every day but i wouldnt fit through the door
4,8,gus,well should we get started
4,8,gus,id like to record this conversation if thats okay
4,8,news reporter,the dea is working on an investigation which may overlap with my own so ive asked them to sit in with us today
4,8,news reporter,gus we all appreciate your coming in here to talk to us but you have the right to have an attorney present also
4,8,walter,oh well i cant see how that would be necessary
4,8,news reporter,but then again i have no idea why im here
4,8,eladio,so you wish to continue
4,8,eladio,please
4,8,walter,sir your fingerprints were found at a crime scene
4,8,eladio,really
4,8,walter,thats surprising
4,8,news reporter,a drugrelated homicide
4,8,news reporter,gale boettichers apartment
4,8,gus,so you knew the victim
4,8,jesse,i named it after maximino arsiniega a dear friend of mine who died too young
4,8,gus,gale was a recipient of this scholarship
4,8,gus,he was uh perhaps one of three dozen
4,8,eladio,i see
4,8,jesse,and mr
4,8,walter,boetticher graduated in that sounds right
4,8,news reporter,and you kept in regular contact with him over all this time
4,8,eladio,oh no
4,8,walter,i hadnt seen gale for years until i ran into him a few weeks ago
4,8,gus,ran into him where
4,8,eladio,at the restaurant
4,8,news reporter,uh well ran into isnt quite accurate as i assume he came by to reestablish contact with me
4,8,news reporter,he invited me to dinner the following night and i accepted
4,8,gus,it was uh perhaps a week later i read about him in the paper
4,8,jesse,drug related you said
4,8,eladio,its a good possibility
4,8,gus,the paper made no mention of that
4,8,gus,i assumed that it was a random crime
4,8,news reporter,so after years with no contact he shows up in your restaurant remakes your acquaintance and invites you to dinner
4,8,news reporter,yeah he wanted money
4,8,jesse,gale boetticher asked you for money
4,8,news reporter,he didnt come right out and say that
4,8,news reporter,he spoke in terms of a vague investment opportunity but it was my suspicion yes as to why he invited me into his home
4,8,walter,he was a very talented chemist but for reasons i never understood he was more interested in taking shortcuts than what would or could have been a very promising career
4,8,gus,but personal shortcomings notwithstanding he was a warm gentle person and i thought a lot of him
4,8,gus,at any rate i uh declined his business offer and after what was a very pleasant meal left
4,8,gus,can you tell us where you were on the night of wednesday the 23rd at around 8 p
4,8,news reporter,not an accusation just a question
4,8,eladio,oh i understand
4,8,news reporter,lets see
4,8,news reporter,i was at a fundraiser at presbyterian hospital
4,8,gus,i was there from 7 to about 10
4,8,eladio,anyone else
4,8,gus,just uh just one other thing
4,8,eladio,uh is gustavo fring your real name
4,8,gus,i know youre a chilean national but there are no records of you ever living there
4,8,eladio,really
4,8,news reporter,i mean records show that you immigrated to mexico in 1986 and then a couple of years later you were granted an entry visa to the united states
4,8,walter,but theres no record of gustavo fring ever having existed in chile which i find i dont know uh strange
4,8,gus,well really it isnt
4,8,gus,general pinochets government was guilty of a great many sins
4,8,news reporter,first and foremost were his human rights abuses
4,8,gus,but it was also notoriously unreliable at keeping records
4,8,jesse,im sure if you keep digging youll find me
4,8,gus,i think thats it gus
4,8,walter,uh thank you
4,8,walter,i hope that i was of some small help
4,8,jesse,you were absolutely
4,8,walter,thank you
4,8,walter,youre very welcome
4,8,jesse,good to see you again
4,8,eladio,oh no
4,8,eladio,no please please
4,8,walter,thank you
4,8,walter,thanks
4,8,news reporter,gentlemen
4,8,news reporter,this thing with his name what are you thinking there
4,8,news reporter,sure the record keeping in south america is hit or miss
4,8,gus,i mean we run into that all the time right
4,8,hank,we usually find something
4,8,gus,i mean before 86 this guys a ghost
4,8,news reporter,if the state department wasnt satisfied with his records they wouldnt have naturalized him
4,8,walter,well maybe but he immigrated from mexico in 89
4,8,gus,you know the state just wasnt as tough on background checks pre911
4,8,news reporter,regardless i dont know what this has to do with the case at hand
4,8,gus,i was definitely curious when his prints show up at boettichers apartment but for me the scholarship thing explains it
4,8,walter,well ill admit to a certain degree of bias
4,8,gus,this man has been a longtime friend of dea but that being said uh i thought his story was credible
4,8,walter,well i agree
4,8,gus,i think it was a good story
4,8,walter,still why are we hearing it now
4,8,eladio,what do you mean
4,8,news reporter,well like you said hes a this mans a big law enforcement booster
4,8,walter,one day hes reading a newspaper and sees that somebody he just had dinner with somebody he thought a lot of was mrderd
4,8,gus,he reads this and he doesnt make a phone call
4,8,gus,doesnt call you or one of his other cop friends to share his connection with the case or ask about the investigation
4,8,eladio,what do you think tim
4,8,gus,well i want to follow up on the scholarship the alibi
4,8,gus,but my overall impression
4,8,news reporter,i believed him
4,8,jesse,nice touch
4,8,walter,bird bath
4,8,walter,hows it hanging
4,8,eladio,good
4,8,gus,whats the damage
4,8,walter,i did a lot of researching for this neighborhood
4,8,eladio,its a pretty good deal
4,8,gus,you kidding me
4,8,gus,uh speaking of which ahem
4,8,news reporter,thats for the week plus theres a little extra in there for any moverelated incidentals
4,8,walter,thank you
4,8,gus,hey champ hows the new school
4,8,eladio,good
4,8,gus,i loved school when i was your age
4,8,news reporter,seesaws story time chasing girls with sticks
4,8,walter,ha ha ha ha
4,8,gus,it wasnt until the fifth grade that i found out she liked me too
4,8,gus,but by then her family had moved to scottsdale so carpe diem okay
4,8,eladio,all right good boy
4,8,gus,so um youll thank jesse again from both of us

4,8,walter,ill catch you later
4,8,jesse,hey you going to need a ride home
4,8,gus,anyway im proud for not losing my cool

4,8,walter,i guess i am
4,8,gus,actually im thinking about making a move up to management
4,8,news reporter,ah jesus
4,8,news reporter,i would be a vast improvement
4,8,news reporter,no one in kleinmans entire front office knows the first thing about giving an xray which just ahh
4,8,news reporter,hey dad uh whatever happened with your scan
4,8,gus,did did you get the results back
4,8,gus,i did

4,8,jesse,hey walt can you do me a favor
4,8,news reporter,uh maries working tomorrow and theres this gem and mineral show thats opening at the fairgrounds
4,8,walter,i wondered if you can maybe give me a lift
4,8,eladio,i had a collection of my own back in high school
4,8,eladio,i mean nothing fancy
4,8,gus,just entrylevel beryls and garnets one passable black tourmaline

4,8,walter,he he he sponsors the dea fun run every year
4,8,eladio,you youve met him
4,8,gus,yeah the the fun run guy
4,8,eladio,yeah that that guy yeah
4,8,eladio,what about him
4,8,news reporter,well i suspect and i cant prove it mind you but i suspect the mans a drug dealer
4,8,gus,i mean honest to god i really believe that this guys maybe one of the biggest movers in the southwest
4,8,walter,remember gale boetticher
4,8,gus,the uh that sad sack from the karaoke video tape
4,8,gus,and you said that he didnt strike you as being the bossman type that probably there was a much bigger guy out there right
4,8,eladio,hank that was that was just speculation
4,8,eladio,doesnt matter
4,8,walter,and guess what i find
4,8,gus,chicken mans fingerprints at boettichers mrder scene
4,8,walter,so we bring him in you think that that gustavo fring klled gale boetticher
4,8,walter,well probably not
4,8,gus,i mean these guys use you know like a dunce to pull the trigger right
4,8,gus,but his fingerprints being there was enough for us to bring him in
4,8,gus,so i so you brought him in to the police
4,8,gus,right
4,8,news reporter,he sits down to talk with us
4,8,gus,the problem is that he what did you ask him

4,8,gus,im just uh interested
4,8,gus,yeah all right
4,8,gus,so we bring him in and he proceeds to kick our asses okay
4,8,gus,hes got an explanation for the fingerprints right
4,8,news reporter,hes got an alibi for gales mrder
4,8,walter,i mean hes got reasons for everything
4,8,gus,this guy is terms of endearment convincing
4,8,eladio,so hes not guilty
4,8,news reporter,well as far as dea and apd are concerned hes not
4,8,hank,officially frings not a suspect

4,8,walter,and all of a sudden he has me pulling into your restaurant and and and telling me that hes investigating you
4,8,eladio,look you and i weve had our differences but i would never look mmy brotherinlaw evidencewise has nothing
4,8,news reporter,hes hes operating on pure conjecture and no one not one person that he works with thinks that you are anyone other than an owner of a fast food chain
4,8,gus,but if something were to happen to hank then that would only draw their attention to you and therefore to me as well
4,8,news reporter,so we have a mutual interest in resolving this without volence
4,8,walter,i will make sure that he discovers nothing
4,8,gus,jesse
4,8,walter,what
4,8,gus,dont wait to be like invited

4,8,eladio,i assume you havent done it
4,8,jesse,you didnt lose it did you
4,8,eladio,you would tell me if you lost it right
4,8,news reporter,oh jesus

4,8,eladio,did you hear what i just said
4,8,gus,my brotherinlaw is on to gus
4,8,gus,your brotherinlaw okay
4,8,gus,im thinking
4,8,jesse,look uh so what if this is like math or algebra
4,8,jesse,you add a plus douche bag to a minus douche bag and you get like zero douche bags
4,8,walter,ive got some math for you
4,8,walter,hank catching gus equals hank catching us
4,8,walter,hank geez
4,8,gus,hes relentless all right
4,8,news reporter,he wont quit
4,8,walter,yeah well hes got nothing is all i can say
4,8,jesse,oh and how would you know that
4,8,walter,because hes still above ground
4,8,jesse,you think a dude like gus would let your boy anywhere near him
4,8,news reporter,hell break out his box cutter on his sorry gimp ass
4,8,walter,so you havent even seen him since that time at the diner
4,8,walter,um theyve got to be figuring that weve talked so you need to tell mike that you are worried about hanks investigation
4,8,gus,hank already knows who you are by the way
4,8,gus,and besides you actually did kll gale so theres that
4,8,walter,this is all good fodder for you to request a sitdown with gus so you can discuss what you would say in case hank brings you in for questioning
4,8,eladio,now you just you just say that you want to be no that that you need to be able to be properly coached and when youre near him you put this to use
4,8,walter,hes just going to tell me to shut my mouth if i get busted
4,8,gus,he aint going to set up no meeting
4,8,gus,well then insist on it damn it
4,8,gus,gus ass is on the line and trust me
4,8,news reporter,he will meet with you if he thinks that youre a liability
4,8,walter,no he will waste me if he thinks im a liability
4,8,eladio,you know what
4,8,walter,whatever man
4,8,gus,im going to take a piss
4,8,gus,uh i think you got a phone call
4,8,gus,yes
4,8,walter,i did some digging around
4,8,jesse,and
4,8,gus,neither the dea nor the apd considers you a person of interest
4,8,gus,schraders looking into you totally on his lonesome
4,8,news reporter,a voice in the wilderness
4,8,gus,does he have resources
4,8,news reporter,from what i hear he would be committing career su1c1de if he were to mention you to merkert again
4,8,gus,so no warrant for the tracking device on my car
4,8,gus,the guys gone totally maverick
4,8,news reporter,hes miss daisy with binoculars
4,8,walter,we watch our backs make sure we dont throw him any bones hell never make a case
4,8,eladio,what about chile
4,8,gus,if i cant find any trace of you before 89 i seriously doubt schrader can
4,8,gus,seems to me the bigger problems the cartel
4,8,gus,we can handle them if thats all weve got on our plate
4,8,news reporter,but dealing with both schrader and the mexicans at the same time if he happens to be watching when they make a move they could be the perfect storm
4,8,walter,thank you

4,9,jesse,how he never goes anywhere one restaurant home one restaurant home back and forth back and forth
4,9,jesse,which now im even more convinced is bullshit because the man owns 13 other restaurants right
4,9,jesse,so i started thinking about this little empire of his right
4,9,jesse,fourteen restaurants
4,9,jesse,who supplies them
4,9,jesse,whats the base of operations
4,9,jesse,so i do a little diggin and bingo

4,9,walter,you look happy
4,9,jesse,last time i saw you hi there
4,9,jesse,uh thing is skyler um i really need to talk to you
4,9,jesse,ted i really dont think we have anything to talk about
4,9,jesse,actually we do
4,9,jesse,an audit
4,9,jesse,wait an audit tomorrow
4,9,walter,how long have you had this
4,9,jesse,awhile
4,9,jesse,id debated you know contacting you
4,9,jesse,contact me
4,9,jesse,what about a lawyer
4,9,walter,ted ted this is this is the cid
4,9,jesse,the criminal division
4,9,jesse,my god you facing a felony charge here
4,9,mike,100000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe plus five years in prison
4,9,hank,yeah
4,9,walter,its bad
4,9,hank,yeah
4,9,walter,it most certainly is
4,9,jesse,look heres the thing
4,9,jesse,i was wondering maybe if um theres some way you could help with this
4,9,gus,help
4,9,gus,help how
4,9,jesse,well with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are maybe theres some way you could uh undo whats in there
4,9,walter,you want me to uncook your books
4,9,jesse,maybe theres some method or some accounting trick  you could you know use  ted
4,9,jesse,it doesnt work like that
4,9,mike,the damage is already my name
4,9,jesse,my signatures are all over those books
4,9,jesse,skyler im accountable not you
4,9,jesse,let me explain whats gonna happen here okay
4,9,jesse,once the cid sees this as willful tax fraud there are going to build the strongest possible case against you and once they start down that path they have an 80 conviction rate
4,9,jesse,thats because theyre allowed to monitor your mail and tap your phones and not just you ted
4,9,jesse,everyone involved in those books
4,9,walter,i cant have this in my life
4,9,jesse,i cannot be audited
4,9,jesse,skyler you you youre going to be fine okay
4,9,jesse,theyre after me
4,9,jesse,its the captain they want not some cashier at a car wash
4,9,walter,no offense
4,9,skyler,im sorry
4,9,mike,i uh i dont want you to worry okay
4,9,jesse,im gonna figure out a way through this
4,9,jesse,somehow
4,9,skyler,here
4,9,walter,right here
4,9,jesse,so is he gonna kll him
4,9,jesse,is who gonna kll who
4,9,walter,gus
4,9,jesse,is he gonna kll mr
4,9,jesse,whites brotherinlaw
4,9,jesse,i mean hes the reason for all this here right
4,9,jesse,because its totally logical for him to off the dude
4,9,jesse,ahole dea agent pokin around your junk who needs that right
4,9,jesse,makes sense to get rid of him for good
4,9,jesse,but klling a cop i dont know
4,9,jesse,it could look suspicious if uh the dude whos investigating you suddenly up and dies
4,9,jesse,then theres theres mr
4,9,jesse,white
4,9,jesse,whod be even more ape shit if he had family getting mrderd
4,9,gus,hed never cook for gus again
4,9,jesse,guess theres a lot of angles to consider
4,9,jesse,if something were to happen to the man would you have a problem with that
4,9,jesse,who really cares what i think
4,9,jesse,son of a btch
4,9,jesse,you get comfortable kid
4,9,gus,we may be here a while
4,9,jesse,hey
4,9,walter,get down
4,9,walter,should i even ask
4,9,jesse, i wouldnt
4,9,hank,so what
4,9,walter,is this going to be a regular thing now
4,9,walter,meth cooking and corpse disposal
4,9,walter,jesus
4,9,mike,just grab us a spare barrel walter
4,9,walter,what was it this time
4,9,walter,what did this poor bastard do to piss off gus
4,9,walter,or did gus just need to send another message
4,9,mike,shut your mouth
4,9,mike,you shut your mouth or ill shut it for you
4,9,mike,i dont want you talking to me or jesse
4,9,mike,just get the barrel
4,9,mike,and if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again you go ahead and get two barrels
4,9,jesse,yo like uh i guess i never thanked you for what you did
4,9,jesse,thanks
4,9,jesse,next time dont stand there like an idiot
4,9,walter,move your feet run and so forth
4,9,jesse,but seriously what what was the deal with gus
4,9,jesse, the deal
4,9,jesse, the terminator shit
4,9,jesse,walking right into the bllts
4,9,jesse,what the hell was he doing
4,9,gus,the cartel needs gus
4,9,jesse,his distribution network
4,9,jesse,theyre not looking to kll him
4,9,jesse,but what
4,9,jesse,the rest of us are like open season
4,9,jesse,is he doing anything about that
4,9,jesse,or do we just keep hanging out for target practice while hes kid
4,9,hank,enough
4,9,gus,you got questions ask him yourself
4,9,gus,and here again
4,9,gus,unreported income
4,9,jesse,thats more than a year straight so far
4,9,jesse,do you want to say something about this
4,9,jesse,because im having a hard time figuring it out
4,9,jesse,well i id have to um have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory
4,9,jesse,take all the time you need mr
4,9,gus,beneke
4,9,gus,thats why were here
4,9,skyler,oh i am so sorry i am late
4,9,hank,i got lost
4,9,skyler,hey ted
4,9,ted,sky
4,9,jesse,whoo
4,9,skyler,this building is so confusing
4,9,skyler,there are doors everywhere
4,9,skyler,ooh
4,9,jesse,skyler white
4,9,jesse,white
4,9,jesse,you are the accountant of record for many of these reports
4,9,walter,is that correct
4,9,jesse, guilty as charged
4,9,jesse,well then perhaps you can shed some light on this history of missing revenue
4,9,jesse,missing
4,9,jesse,uhhuh
4,9,jesse,no its there
4,9,hank,revenue most definitely flowed through this company
4,9,mike,but its not all accounted for in your reports
4,9,jesse,huh
4,9,jesse,hmm lets take a look
4,9,walter,well you know this account here
4,9,gus,that is mr
4,9,jesse,kellers account and mr
4,9,jesse,kellers an old friend of teds dad and he always sends an electronic payment which personally i hate because im a real paper person but mr
4,9,mike,kellers one of those environmental people
4,9,jesse,so anyway since there wasnt a physical check i didnt enter it into the book but the moneys there
4,9,jesse,white youve read section 61 of the irc
4,9,jesse,i did not follow what you just said
4,9,gus,how gross income for a business is defined
4,9,jesse,youre not allowed to do that
4,9,jesse,well i think i am
4,9,jesse,no youre not
4,9,jesse,well you know what they say about opinions right
4,9,jesse,everyones got one
4,9,skyler,but seriously i am
4,9,jesse,look it doesnt matter if its an electronic check or a paper check income is income
4,9,jesse,youre not allowed to not declare it
4,9,jesse,when i input everything into the quicken nothing flashed red so thats gotta mean its okay right
4,9,jesse,quicken
4,9,jesse,uhhuh
4,9,jesse,you used quicken to manage books for a business this size
4,9,jesse,i did
4,9,walter,oh do you guys use that here
4,9,jesse,cause it is the best
4,9,jesse,its like having a calculator on your computer
4,9,jesse,amazing
4,9,walter,white how did you get this job
4,9,gus, oh ted hired me
4,9,jesse,i mean your qualifications
4,9,gus,what are your qualifications
4,9,jesse,where did you get your training
4,9,jesse,ooh well i havent had any training per se ive always been naturally good with numbers
4,9,jesse,got a good instinct for them
4,9,jesse,right teddy
4,9,jesse,right
4,9,jesse,this is all falling into place now
4,9,jesse,white i just have to ask
4,9,gus,youre not managing accounts anywhere else are you
4,9,walter,right now
4,9,jesse,im a cashier at a car wash
4,9,jesse,im not really clear about what happened in there
4,9,gus,what happened is good news

4,11,jesse,that or you just dont feel like talking to me
4,11,walter,anyway why ive been calling is because that thing we discussed
4,11,walter,well ive been thinking and uh i decided i cant do it
4,11,jesse,i know thats probably not what you wanted to hear but hopefully youll understand and if you wanted to talk some more about it thats fine
4,11,walter,so call me
4,11,walter,im around
4,11,walter, hey
4,11,walter,hey
4,11,walter,come on in
4,11,jesse,first i want to tell you that i get it
4,11,walter,from what youve told me this situation with walts gambling soundsintense
4,11,jesse,yeah it definitely was and continues to be
4,11,walter,so i would greatly appreciate it if you would just help me out here
4,11,jesse,well i have thought long and hard about this and uh heres what i want to do
4,11,walter,so is uh walt gonna be okay
4,11,walter,are you in contact with him
4,11,jesse,um hes fine
4,11,walter,good
4,11,walter,thats good
4,11,jesse,he doesnt know about you offering uh no absolutely not and i mean to keep it that way so 617000 written out to me
4,11,walter,uh what is this
4,11,jesse, i cant take your money
4,11,walter,and why is that
4,11,walter,because at the end of the day paying my debt with illicit gambling winnings i dont know
4,11,walter,it feels wrong
4,11,walter,it feels wrong
4,11,jesse, to me it does
4,11,walter,im not judging you or walt
4,11,walter,im just saying i feel uncomfortable with it
4,11,walter,well um ted the whole reason were in this mess is because you had me cooking your books
4,11,jesse,so when did wrong suddenly become a problem for you
4,11,jesse,now hold on
4,11,walter,that was a onetime measure
4,11,jesse,i took an honest attempt to protect my employees and save my dads company
4,11,walter,and it mightve been a mistake but thats no reason to go out and make another
4,11,walter,this is the big mistake right here
4,11,walter,you owe the federal government 617000
4,11,walter,if you do not pay them they will come after you and then they will come after me
4,11,walter,and if they audit my business find out that walt and i paid for it with close to a million dollars in untaxed gambling winnings we will go to prison where you will already be
4,11,jesse,do you understand
4,11,walter,i understand youre upset but i think youre overstating things too
4,11,walter,no ones going to prison
4,11,jesse,oh my god
4,11,jesse,how are you not following me here
4,11,eladio,fine
4,11,walter,lets say i take your advice
4,11,walter,i pay the irs
4,11,jesse,then what
4,11,walter,then you dont owe them
4,11,walter,but i still owe the bank skyler
4,11,walter,im still gonna go bankrupt
4,11,jesse,i still have to pull my girls out of school
4,11,jesse,so if im understanding you correctly youre saying you cant take the money i gave you but you can take a larger amount
4,11,walter,im just saying as much as i appreciate the gesture the money you gave me doesnt really change anything
4,11,walter,because its not enough
4,11,jesse,dont twist my words
4,11,walter,this isnt about amounts
4,11,walter,this is about me doing the right thing
4,11,walter,ted are you blackmailing me
4,11,jesse, what
4,11,walter,blackmailing
4,11,walter,i feel like im not explaining things right
4,11,walter,i think youre explaining it fine
4,11,walter,i notice that uh this is for less than what i gave you by the way
4,11,walter,thats the mercedes
4,11,walter,i leased it before i knew where the money came from
4,11,jesse,and now that you know you will of course be returning it
4,11,walter,well the leases are pretty ironclad so i have to see whats possible
4,11,jesse,but yeah im gonna do my best
4,11,walter,and i will pay you back as soon as i can
4,11,walter,i dont want you to pay me ted
4,11,walter,i want you to pay them
4,11,walter,but skyl try it again

4,12,saul,im stuck in a wheelchair
4,12,walter,im not even on the job
4,12,walter,no someone doesnt like the way ive been spending my free time
4,12,jesse,what minerals
4,12,saul,i mean i start looking into you know fring and all of a sudden im under lockdown for my own protection
4,12,walter,wait a minute
4,12,walter,whoa whoa whoa
4,12,jesse,what
4,12,saul,gus fring
4,12,walter,from the chicken restaurant
4,12,jesse,hank what are you talking about
4,12,walter,just one mans humble opinion
4,12,walter,thats all but i think los pollos hermanos is a front for the biggest meth distributor in the southwest
4,12,walter,oh my god
4,12,walter,steve  oh my god
4,12,jesse,are you are you even looking into this
4,12,walter,were looking into everything but we work on fact not conjecture and the fact is that the scumbags that hit you first were mexican cartel not some german multinational whatever and definitely not colonel sanders
4,12,walter,now if we even had a shred of proof isnt that what you get paid to go get
4,12,saul,remember that laundry i told you about
4,12,walter,id start there
4,12,walter,come on man
4,12,saul,its a perfect spot for a meth superlab
4,12,walter,oh my god
4,12,walter,hey what if im right
4,12,walter,even if you were right and you aint but if you were theres no way in hell a judge is going to give me a search warrant search warrant
4,12,jesse,what happened to good oldfashioned knock and talk
4,12,walter,oh thats right
4,12,walter,i forgot
4,12,walter,you were never very good at those were you
4,12,jesse, can i help you
4,12,walter, yes sir
4,12,walter,my friend and i we wondered if we could take a look around
4,12,gus,why
4,12,walter, dennis
4,12,jesse,dennis
4,12,walter,hey im steve gomez
4,12,walter,im with the dea drug enforcement
4,12,jesse,what is there there a problem
4,12,walter,not for you
4,12,jesse,no no problem
4,12,walter,were just wondering if we could take a look around
4,12,walter,i uh can i tell you a story
4,12,saul, yeah
4,12,walter,i bust this chef
4,12,walter,well he says hes a chef but just because you work at a restaurant that charges 14 for a burger that dont make you a chef
4,12,walter,that makes you a glorified burger flipper at least in my book
4,12,saul,yeah
4,12,walter,anyway so we bust this chef heroin possession
4,12,jesse,he says well just because you found heroin in my chef whites doesnt make it mine
4,12,walter, maybe it came from the place that launders my chef whites this place
4,12,walter,oh come on man
4,12,walter,i dont want to do this stuff with you
4,12,walter,ii know i know
4,12,saul,you dont have to say it
4,12,walter,ill say it for you
4,12,walter,his story is a big load of steaming horse shit
4,12,walter,i mean were going to find heroin here like were going to find jimmy hoffa
4,12,saul,right
4,12,walter,the thing is is that the chefs daddy is a united states senator
4,12,walter,im not going to tell you which one but you probably know who he is right
4,12,walter,so now ive got to waste my time checking out this burger flippers story and if i dont his old mans going to jam me up my asac my whole entire office
4,12,jesse,politics huh
4,12,walter,so what do you think
4,12,walter,listen you know what
4,12,walter,i have to check with my boss and hes out of town and i cant promise ill reach him anytime soon either you know
4,12,walter,well yeah thats probably the way to go so ill have to go get a warrant and well do it official but youre probably going to have to close down for the day
4,12,jesse,what
4,12,gus,why
4,12,jesse,twenty agents poking around
4,12,walter,come on itll be less trouble if it was just us two but your call
4,12,walter,just the two of you
4,12,saul,youll make it quick right
4,12,saul,dennis well be like the wind
4,12,skyler,ookay
4,12,saul,could you tell him
4,12,skyler, okay
4,12,skyler,okay
4,12,walter,oh and dennis can you clear out some of your people for us
4,12,walter,confuses the dogs nose
4,12,walter,so how long we gotta be quiet down here
4,12,walter,then what happens after this provided they dont find their way in here and bust our asses
4,12,walter,im gonna be like stuck down here in a laundry hamper for the rest of eternity
4,12,walter,this this blows
4,12,jesse,hello

4,12,jesse,you know i get it

4,13,saul,ricin
4,13,saul,yeah ricin thats definitely a big one

4,13,skyler,pinkman said it was like he was torturing the old guy
4,13,saul,what does that mean
4,13,saul,he told him the last of his family was dead
4,13,saul,he seemed to enjoy telling him
4,13,walter,afterward pinkman asked him about it
4,13,saul,all gus would say was that this tio character once mrderd someone close to him
4,13,skyler,tio mrderd someone close to gus
4,13,saul,i know it sound not particularly fruitful but sorry thats all i got

5,1,mike,what the hell difference does it make
5,1,mike,they got it
5,1,mike,end of story
5,1,mike,apd northwest area command on 2nd
5,1,mike,they tagged it they filed it its in the system and they locked it in their evidence room
5,1,walter,all right
5,1,walter,all right
5,1,walter,so describe the building
5,1,mike,describe the how about i describe fort knox
5,1,mike,and what are you going to do
5,1,mike,are you going to put on your black leotard and go dangling on a close line
5,1,mike,its a building full of cops
5,1,mike,what else do you need to know
5,1,mike,and why in the hell am i talking to you
5,1,jesse,mike we gotta do something
5,1,mike,i am doing something
5,1,jesse,hes good with this stuff
5,1,jesse,just give him a chance
5,1,saul,now you look
5,1,mike,that laptop might as well be on the moon
5,1,mike,they build these evidence rooms like bank vaults because guess what
5,1,mike,lunatics like you want to break into them
5,1,mike,but unlike a bank vault this is a place that is guarded 24 hours a day by the police
5,1,mike,theres no way youre getting it out of there
5,1,walter,who said that we have to get it out of there
5,1,walter,we just need to destroy whats on it
5,1,mike,oh so now you want to blow up a police station
5,1,walter,i dont believe i said that no
5,1,mike,nursing home full of old folks just whet your appetite
5,1,mike,now you want to kll a bunch of cops
5,1,walter,ive never said anything about klling anybody
5,1,walter,i am however considering the possibility of a device
5,1,walter,a device
5,1,walter,yes a small device
5,1,walter,say this device gets filed into evidence
5,1,walter,now it is inside that room
5,1,jesse,what about a magnet
5,1,mike,you want to commit a whole other crime just to get this bmb of yours into evidence
5,1,walter,who said bmb
5,1,walter,i said a device
5,1,jesse,yo what about like a magnet
5,1,walter, an incendiary device
5,1,walter,one quick fire is all it would take
5,1,mike,you dont think they have fire suppression
5,1,mike,im not talking about sprinklers
5,1,mike,im talking about halon because halon doesnt destroy evidence
5,1,jesse,a magnet though maybe like  all right so a bmb then
5,1,walter,maybe we plant a bmb outside
5,1,mike,oh actually i knew a crew out of fort worth that tried to blow up an evidence room from outside
5,1,mike,about all they did was take out a couple of hedges
5,1,mike,you are probably talking about 2 feet of reinforced concrete
5,1,jesse,or what about a magnet
5,1,walter,what magnet
5,1,walter,what about it
5,1,saul,you know just a so what do you think
5,1,walter,expensive
5,1,mike,leaving aside engineering rigging some kind of alternate power source my primary sticking point is i actually need the thing as you gentlemen can see its paying the bills
5,1,walter,but i mean its feasible doable
5,1,mike,hey were living in a time of uh string theories and god particles
5,1,walter,feasible doable
5,1,mike,yeah sure why not
5,1,walter,expensive
5,1,saul,what would you put it in
5,1,jesse,what about that
5,1,mike,does it run
5,1,walter,we can get it running
5,1,saul,whats the box made of
5,1,mike,plywood and aluminum just what you need
5,1,mike,all right so you want to talk money
5,1,mike,step into my office
5,1,mike,hey listen

5,2,mike,thanks
5,2,hank,i hired peter schuler in 1992
5,2,hank,almost singlehandedly he grew up a little restaurant division into an industry leader and a source of great personal pride
5,2,hank,i am shocked and saddened by his death and outraged by the damage his actions have brought upon my grandfathers company
5,2,mike,alleged actions
5,2,mike,an innocent man does not kll himself
5,2,hank,my people and i are here to help
5,2,hank,through your investigation i pledge madrigals full cooperation and transparency
5,2,mike,i confess i have my selfish reasons
5,2,hank,i believe peter schuler was a lone anomaly
5,2,hank,but if that is not the case i want to know it just as you do
5,2,gomez,so when you gonna announce it
5,2,mike,i dont know
5,2,hank,as im walking out the door with my big cardboard box
5,2,hank,you cant do that

5,2,hank,turns out a couple of days before it happened desk sergeant gets this phone call from a postal inspector quote unquote wanting to know where they keep the thing
5,2,hank,and he told them
5,2,hank,anything left of the laptop
5,2,hank,do we look that lucky
5,2,hank,you know i sneaked a peek before apd took it out of frings office
5,2,hank,the whole thing was encrypted
5,2,merkert,they wouldnt have got anything anyway but so hector salamanca klled fring
5,2,merkert,but who gave salamanca the bmb
5,2,hank,whole lot of questions and not much in the way of answers

5,2,merkert,they picked him up last night
5,2,hank,my guys are solid
5,2,hank,i vetted them with great care and fring made sure they were well compensated in the event of a situation such as this
5,2,hank,theyre paid to stand up to the heat keep their mouths shut no matter what
5,2,hank,and they will
5,2,hank,now i dont know what kind of movies youve been watching but here in the real world we dont kll 11 people as some kind of prophylactic measure

5,2,gomez,could you state that to the camera please
5,2,mike,im waiving my right to have an attorney present
5,2,hank,uh okay then
5,2,hank,we just have a few questions
5,2,hank,youre currently employed by the pollos hermanos chain
5,2,hank,is that correct

5,2,hank,and what do you do there
5,2,hank, corporate security
5,2,hank,corporate security
5,2,hank, yeah

5,2,hank,like uh guarding the special sauce
5,2,mike,i conduct employee background checks i oversee loss prevention
5,2,hank,at a fastfood restaurant thats a fulltime job
5,2,mike,we have 14 locations
5,2,mike,so yes its a fulltime job
5,2,hank,yeah well if i were you id start sending out those resumes
5,2,hank,it says here youre a private investigator
5,2,hank,where you licensed
5,2,mike,new mexico arizona utah
5,2,mike,every state where we operate
5,2,hank,colorado
5,2,hank,you have some restaurants there right
5,2,mike,colorado doesnt require licensure
5,2,hank,you licensed to carry a firearm
5,2,mike,concealed carry
5,2,mike,yes i am
5,2,hank,which states
5,2,mike,itd be quicker to mention the states in which im not
5,2,hank,and if we pulled your ccps everything would be in order
5,2,mike,im guessing youve already done that so you tell me
5,2,hank,you strike me as a former cop
5,2,hank,am i right
5,2,hank,where at
5,2,mike,philadelphia
5,2,hank,philly
5,2,hank,the city of brotherly love
5,2,hank,it turns out we uh we know some folks there and they told us that your tenure as a police officer ended somewhat uh dramatically
5,2,hank,you wanna talk about that
5,2,mike,not particularly
5,2,hank,yeah me neither
5,2,hank,see im more interested in why gus fring decided to put a guy like you in charge of his corporate security
5,2,hank,i mean given your history doing background checks on pimplefaced fry cooks
5,2,hank,seems like over what else you do for fring
5,2,hank,he mustve needed help running that drug empire of his no
5,2,hank,drug empire
5,2,mike,first im hearing about that
5,2,mike,i dont know anything about that
5,2,gomez,hey man we have a guy that could put you in that underground lab and hell testify to it
5,2,gomez,so from here on out this can go hard or easy so whats it gonna be
5,2,mike,forget your handcuffs
5,2,mike,im confused
5,2,mike,am i under arrest here or am i not
5,2,mike,you wanna state that for the camera
5,2,hank,you are not under arrest currently
5,2,mike,agents do you have any more questions for me
5,2,mike,because youve got me very stirred up with all these false accusations
5,2,mike,if im not under arrest id prefer to leave
5,2,hank,and i suppose we could talk about the two million dollars in your granddaughters name
5,2,hank,yeah
5,2,hank,it seems uh fring had all these secret offshore accounts that he would deposit money into like uh well an even dozen of them and theyre all in the names of certain people on his payroll
5,2,hank,there was the uh the manager of the laundry um a couple guys from the pollos distribution center
5,2,hank,there was the owner of a chemical warehouse a bunch of others
5,2,hank,you know guys that mustve been getting paid off the books
5,2,hank,anyway one of the names was kaylee ehrmantraut
5,2,hank,ten years old and just cute as a button
5,2,hank,yeah
5,2,hank,two million and change we found on deposit for her
5,2,hank,way more than anybody else
5,2,hank,now my partner here he took one look at that and said shit man
5,2,hank,this fifthgrade girl is the muscle behind frings entire operation
5,2,hank, i said whoa whoa
5,2,hank,hey partner slow down there
5,2,hank,maybe it was actually her dear old granddaddy
5,2,hank, impressive no
5,2,hank,but level of insight
5,2,hank,hes not impressed gomie
5,2,gomez,perhaps hes picturing all that money going byebye
5,2,hank,yeah well i mean the governments gonna take every last dollar unless well heres the thing mike or michael
5,2,hank, mr
5,2,mike,ehrmantraut
5,2,hank,heres the thing mike
5,2,hank,lucky for you you didnt touch that money
5,2,hank,i cannot say the same for the other 11 on the list
5,2,gomez,one of your guys is gonna roll on you and then well definitely remember the handcuffs
5,2,hank,now before that day comes you can do yourself a solid
5,2,hank,you can tell us what you know you can tell us whos still out there and if we like your story good things can happen
5,2,gomez,kaylee might be able to keep some of that money
5,2,hank,maybe
5,2,hank,so what do you say
5,2,mike,i dont know anything about any money
5,2,mike,i dont know what youre talking about
5,2,walter,first order of business is to find a new place to cook
5,2,gomez,before anyone says it no more rvs
5,2,mike,i dont know
5,2,hank,the crystal ship did pretty good for us
5,2,hank,the crystal ship
5,2,hank, yeah
5,2,hank,thats what i called it
5,2,gomez,well ill admit it held us on as a starter lab but it was too dark too small not to mention it couldve broken down at any moment
5,2,hank,saul find us someplace safe from prying eyes
5,2,hank,security against detection is paramount
5,2,walter,but i dont wanna drive too far
5,2,hank,no more 50mile treks to some indian reservation
5,2,walter,in town is trickier
5,2,gomez,i mean you got a lot more of your prying eyes
5,2,hank,if gus can manage it then so can we
5,2,hank,precursor
5,2,hank,where are we with that
5,2,merkert,uh were good on everything except uh methylamine
5,2,mike,no surprise
5,2,hank,its just dry as hell out there
5,2,hank,what if we switched back to a pseudo cook
5,2,hank,absolutely out of the question
5,2,hank,jesse there is methylamine out there
5,2,walter,i know it
5,2,hank,yeah but what if theres not
5,2,hank,because there isnt
5,2,hank,i mean really
5,2,hank,there is
5,2,mike,have faith
5,2,hank,can i can i offer a thought
5,2,hank,uh say a guy wins the lottery
5,2,hank,ten million bucks
5,2,hank,the very next day whats the one thing he does not do
5,2,hank,he does not go buy another lottery ticket right
5,2,hank,he counts his lucky stars and he sails off into the sunset which seems to me and all due respect some advice you two might take
5,2,hank,what lottery did i win exactly
5,2,gomez,hey youre alive
5,2,hank,i mean as far as im concerned thats the irish sweepstakes
5,2,walter,im alive and im broke
5,2,hank,counting the money that i owe jesse im about 40 grand in the hole
5,2,hank,does that seem like an acceptable stopping point to you
5,2,walter,there is gold in the streets just waiting for someone to come and scoop it up
5,2,mike,but me

5,3,mike,mike im extending you the uhhuh
5,3,jesse,now that were all together here are the ground rules division of labor i handle the business
5,3,mike,making the stuff thats your end
5,3,mike,i dont tell you how to mix your chemicals and whatnot and you do not tell me how to take care of business
5,3,marie,is that absolutely clear
5,3,marie,sure
5,3,jesse,all right
5,3,jesse,lets take the tour
5,3,mike,hey youre okay with that
5,3,saul,yes
5,3,jesse,he handles the business and i handle him
5,3,skyler,clearly were talking about renting not buying
5,3,mike,you need an ongoing business someplace you can slide in do your thing and remain anonymous
5,3,mike,im not gonna mince words
5,3,walter,this is your best bet
5,3,skyler,got machines running forklifts people coming and going
5,3,mike,youre gonna stay way under the radar
5,3,jesse,and the owners solid
5,3,mike,he cant wait to throw up a curtain wall stack some boxes in front of it give you all the space you need
5,3,mike,after that hes got his business youve got yours and never the twain shall meet
5,3,skyler,its outstanding
5,3,marie,am i right
5,3,skyler,machines like this gotta be plenty of power
5,3,jesse,what about the smell
5,3,mike,more good news
5,3,marie,ive been here when its up and running
5,3,mike,this place stinks already
5,3,mike,youll blend right in
5,3,marie,how many employees
5,3,mike,i knew youd ask
5,3,mike,sixteen illegals all highly motivated to stay deaf blind and dumb
5,3,mike,youll want to vet them im sure
5,3,saul,yes indeed
5,3,mike,so what do you say maestro
5,3,walter,huh
5,3,mike,is it unanimous
5,3,mike,you know i worked in a box factory one summer in high school i havent seen one of these in years
5,3,saul,trip down memory lane
5,3,marie,thats perfect
5,3,marie,you know what this is
5,3,mike,its a corrugator
5,3,mike,it uses steam and salt to crimp kraft paper for cardboard
5,3,skyler,and it makes a hell of  doing it which is great right
5,3,mike,steam and salt
5,3,skyler,when this thing is running its like a jungle in here
5,3,jesse,itll ruin the product
5,3,mike,well you cant just hop down to costco and get a couple dehumidifiers
5,3,walter,what fine
5,3,walter,fine
5,3,skyler,moving on
5,3,mike,spacious isolated location no humidity and you get all the free tortillas you want
5,3,jesse,thats the special feature of this place
5,3,mike,yeah i dont know
5,3,jesse,itll make the tortillas smell like cat piss
5,3,jesse,somebodys bound to notice that
5,3,jesse,all right
5,3,mike,well theres gotta be some kind of workaround right
5,3,marie,its a technical problem
5,3,mike,you guys are technical guys
5,3,mike,you know be creative
5,3,mike,put your heads together
5,3,skyler,anything foodrelated is gonna have unannounced government inspections
5,3,mike,all im asking is that you keep an open mind
5,3,marie,dennis already set some spaces behind these keepball games
5,3,skyler,hell no
5,3,mike,i know its a long shot
5,3,mike,all i can say to recommend this one is were talking about an owner here who is how should i put it highly amenable
5,3,jesse,okay
5,3,mike,i get it
5,3,mike,just say no and well go get dinner
5,3,jesse,all right
5,3,jesse,so ill start
5,3,marie,no way were cooking in here
5,3,marie,no space nowhere for the smell to go
5,3,marie,look at that door
5,3,jesse,that thing rolls up and were open to the world
5,3,mike,i dont know if anybody noticed but theres a cop shop a quarter of a mile away
5,3,marie,the hammer comes down its gonna be custers last stand
5,3,marie,its perfect
5,3,walter,what
5,3,mike,how are we gonna fit a lab in here
5,3,saul,who said here
5,3,marie,a house is infested
5,3,marie,termites cockroaches whatever
5,3,marie,homeowners hire a pest control company
5,3,mike,truck rolls up homeowners leave
5,3,marie,the crew tents the house
5,3,marie,they bmb the place with poison
5,3,jesse,the house stays like that for days
5,3,walter,no one looks twice at a tented house
5,3,marie,now maybe theres a strange smell coming out of it
5,3,walter,does someone think to investigate
5,3,saul,anyone go inside
5,3,skyler,hell no
5,3,marie,and thats where well cook
5,3,marie,they tent what three four houses a week
5,3,jesse,so we pick the one thats best for us enough floor space easy access
5,3,mike,once the tent is up we go in we cook a batch we bmb the place and leave
5,3,mike,so we gotta move in and out for every cook
5,3,jesse,set up the lab cook and then take everything down
5,3,skyler,its challenging but doable
5,3,marie,tell me about these guys
5,3,jesse,ponytail on the sidewalk thats ira
5,3,jesse,hes the owner
5,3,mike,on the roof is sandor
5,3,jesse,the ladders fernando and down below thats todd
5,3,mike,the pest control operation is legit
5,3,mike,i mean theyre licensed theyre bonded they do as good a job as anyone in town but theyre also topdrawer secondstory men
5,3,marie,secondstory
5,3,marie,be artists
5,3,mike,theyre burglars
5,3,skyler,yeah
5,3,mike,i mean hey they play it smart
5,3,jesse,they dont boost anything while theyre on the job
5,3,jesse,they copy the keys locate the valuables and alarms and they sell that information to other crews
5,3,mike,or after a decent interval theyll come back and live for goods themselves
5,3,mike,and you know them how
5,3,marie,oh ive been pulling their chestnuts out of the fire legally speaking for five years
5,3,mike,ira and his guys are good
5,3,mike,i mean they know how to keep their mouths shut
5,3,mike,and if you buy them theyre gonna stay bought
5,3,mike,you can check into them yourself
5,3,saul,i will if it comes to that
5,3,saul,so do we take a vote
5,3,walter,why
5,3,mike,we sound great
5,3,saul,rock on man
5,3,marie,that yamahas got a real nice touch
5,3,mike,you like the sound
5,3,jesse,its huge huh
5,3,skyler,yeah its real nice but were looking for something else today
5,3,mike,you got any roadie cases
5,3,marie, for sure what size
5,3,mike, biggest you got
5,3,marie,thatll fit through like a regularsize doorway
5,3,mike,you got it
5,3,mike,follow me
5,3,jesse,top of the line
5,3,marie,recessed hardware foam lining  walls threeinch casters
5,3,mike,height is good width is good
5,3,marie,how much weight will this hold
5,3,saul,its rated for 900 pounds
5,3,mike,so unless your band plays lead bricks you should be okay
5,3,skyler,were gonna need uh hey man im trying to do business over here btch
5,3,marie,sorry
5,3,mike,hes like overly enthusiastic
5,3,mike,anyway um im gonna need four of them
5,3,saul,four
5,3,mike,that gonna be layaway
5,3,marie,i need to see a bunch of ids for that
5,3,mike,no man cash
5,3,jesse,okay
5,3,mike,hey uh you know what
5,3,marie,ill throw in stenciling
5,3,mike,whats your band called
5,3,jesse,damn brother
5,3,marie,not asking no questions but it sure looks like youre back in business
5,3,marie,no joke
5,3,mike,you way back in business man
5,3,skyler,look at this
5,3,skyler,yeah
5,3,jesse,youre stacking the benjies  till the rubber band pops
5,3,skyler,yeah yeah
5,3,mike,alls were saying is we know youre major league now
5,3,mike,but if theres ever anything else you need from us any way we can get in on this at all
5,3,marie,little stuff big stuff we would be all over it
5,3,mike,you know uh maybe someday
5,3,marie,thats cool
5,3,marie,i guess we better hit it then
5,3,skyler,yeah
5,3,mike,keep on keeping on brother
5,3,marie,later
5,3,mike,okay it is the same job as always
5,3,mike,you go out you inspect you deal with the customers regular drill
5,3,jesse,everythings the same except for one important detail
5,3,skyler,no stealing
5,3,skyler,no stealing
5,3,jesse,not a toothpick not the spare change between the couch cushions not the panties out of the hamper
5,3,skyler,nothing
5,3,skyler,and i mean nothing
5,3,mike,and if youre out with your buddies and they ask if you got a hot tip on a be you tell them you got nada
5,3,marie,youre out of the game
5,3,jesse,the bottom line is that these houses are out of bounds now and forever
5,3,saul,got it
5,3,jesse,all right
5,3,mike,from time to time youre gonna see these two
5,3,mike,now as far as youre concerned they are ghosts
5,3,mike,you dont see them
5,3,mike,you dont hear them
5,3,mike,you dont say good morning
5,3,mike, you dont speak unless youre spoken to
5,3,mike,on the other hand if they tell you to jump you dont ask what for you jump
5,3,mike,now you need a name for them
5,3,mike,you call them yes sir and no sir
5,3,mike, you got any problems you come to me

5,3,jesse,the agitation motor here on top the tnks not gonna fit in the box
5,3,jesse,its just uh its just too tall
5,3,jesse,now i thought wed put a collar on the tnk and carry the motor in separately alongside the condenser
5,3,mike,and on the day we just kind of twist it into place you know while were setting up
5,3,skyler,yeah

5,3,mike,i mean youve earned that
5,3,marie,seriously
5,3,skyler,yeah
5,3,walter,secrets create barriers between people
5,3,skyler,im speaking from experience believe me
5,3,mike,all that youve done its a part of you and i mean if you choose to spend the rest of your life with this person then youll have to decide how much youll share with her
5,3,marie,meaning what
5,3,skyler,like everything
5,3,mike,like gale
5,3,mike,im just trying to say that i trust you and i know youll make the right call
5,3,mike,if she loves you shell understand

5,3,skyler,this more ethniclooking one hes doing a great job
5,3,marie,but the other one is going back and forth like hes scrubbing a wall

5,3,jesse,im still gonna take care of the rent and stuff
5,3,skyler,its the right thing to do but you know i meant this
5,3,mike,how are you feeling about the money
5,3,walter,youre looking at it wrong
5,3,marie,when we worked for gus we were cooking this last batch was great but we didnt even crack 50 pounds
5,3,mike,we maybe cleared less money but we got a bigger piece of the pie
5,3,mike,its like you said now were owners not employees
5,3,skyler,ive been thinking about victor
5,3,skyler,yeah
5,3,skyler,yeah
5,3,mike,all this time i was sure that gus did what he did to send me a message
5,3,jesse,maybe theres another reason
5,3,marie,like what
5,3,skyler,victor trying to cook that batch on his own
5,3,skyler,taking liberties that werent his to take
5,3,mike,maybe he flew too close to the sun got his throat cut
5,4,walter,are you moving back in
5,4,walter,yes
5,4,skyler,do you really think thats thats a good idea
5,4,skyler,a list of names
5,4,walter,they trace back to madrigal and theyre gonna get picked up by the police
5,4,skyler,outstanding work hank
5,4,walter,if only we had listened
5,4,walter,its not right to put this on you
5,4,skyler,shut up
5,4,skyler,shut up
5,4,walter,breakdown
5,4,walter,what does that mean
5,4,skyler,it means i dont know what else to call it
5,4,walter,you do know right
5,4,skyler,she was having an affair
5,4,walter,can you still get your hands on methylamine
5,4,skyler,maybe
5,4,walter,i gotta say when you first brought her in i had my doubts
5,4,walter,but your little darlings got nine lives
5,4,skyler,rearwheel assembly took the brunt of the impact so uh yeah
5,4,walter,cv shaft boots joints axle replaced all of it
5,4,skyler,no way around it
5,4,skyler,i went after market on most of the parts here
5,4,skyler,you want me to swap in factory parts thats fine
5,4,walter,but using aftermarkets the only way well keep it under blue book and on the insurance companys dime okay
5,4,skyler,nothing beats free
5,4,skyler,uh swapped out your air filter topped off your fluids
5,4,walter,didnt have to replace the windshield this time
5,4,walter,i know right
5,4,walter,oh and i noticed you had some sort of gunky buildup in the front end here
5,4,skyler,first i had no idea what i was looking at
5,4,skyler,then i remembered that you had me replace that front fender a few months back when you ran over that deer
5,4,walter,we went at it with the steam hose cleaned it up for you
5,4,walter,hardest part was the paint
5,4,walter,fern green
5,4,skyler,interesting tint
5,4,skyler,anything else
5,4,skyler,thats it
5,4,walter,zero balance like i said
5,4,walter,sign here youre good to go
5,4,skyler,people like to joke but i really really like this car

5,4,walter,whats the blue book you mean
5,4,skyler,i mean what will you pay me for this car
5,4,skyler,well im not really looking for 100
5,4,skyler,insurance company just shelled out 1900 for the parts alone
5,4,walter,then its a bargain
5,4,walter,you give me 50 bucks and shes all yours
5,4,skyler,you sure about this

5,4,walter,well no one on frings crew is talking to us
5,4,skyler,i mean not a peep no matter how hard we squeeze
5,4,walter,which makes it likely theres somebody out there keeping them in line
5,4,skyler,our money is on this guy michael ehrmantraut
5,4,walter,hes frings head of corporate security
5,4,skyler,hes a definite hard case
5,4,walter,now were gonna stay on him

5,4,walter,yeah
5,4,walter,some small amounts on the streetside pulls
5,4,skyler,labs telling us its the same stuff
5,4,walter,i mean it could be old inventory leaking out or it could be somebodys rebooting using frings former cooks to set up a new operation
5,4,skyler,i thought we had frings cooks the unsubs in the lab fire
5,4,walter,thought maybe one of them was your heisenberg
5,4,walter,yeah
5,4,skyler,maybe
5,4,skyler,i dont know
5,4,skyler,like i said theres still a lot of questions
5,4,walter,agent gomez could you give us a moment

5,4,walter,so much so that im wondering if its time you made a change
5,4,walter,you know i have to get back to el paso

5,4,walter,if you were to put in an application and i recommend that you do you will get the job
5,4,walter,i have no doubt this do would be well served with you at the helm
5,4,walter,thats uh im not sure what to say
5,4,walter,its a big step up
5,4,skyler,its not without its headaches
5,4,walter,politics may take some getting used to
5,4,walter,plus youd be overseeing every case in the office so youd need to reassign all your daytodays fring included
5,4,walter,much as i hate losing a good field man thats the job and you need to be okay with it

5,4,skyler,none of our business of course
5,4,walter,and hank i dont know if you  picked up on any of  he knows he knows i know
5,4,skyler,these things happen in a marriage but it isnt unfixable
5,4,walter,i think what would be great is if you two had some space to work through this stuff
5,4,skyler,so and keep an open mind here
5,4,skyler,what if we took the kids for a while
5,4,skyler, took the kids
5,4,walter, absolutely
5,4,walter,well look after them for a day or two or however long and leave you and skyler to look after each other
5,4,walter,uh thats very generous of you marie but i i just dont see how thats a solution
5,4,skyler,and i mean besides junior and holly thats a lot of work
5,4,skyler,no it isnt
5,4,walter,juniors independent and my niece is only the easiest most delicious baby that was ever born
5,4,walter,itll be fun right

5,4,walter,yeah
5,4,walter,absolutely
5,4,walter,yeah
5,4,walter,its a good idea
5,4,walter,i think its a great idea
5,4,walter,just the thing for both of you
5,4,walter,marie this idea was it yours
5,4,walter,actually it was skylers
5,4,walter,she really needs this walt
5,4,walter,i gave marie bottles
5,4,walter,theyll stop and pick up diapers on their way
5,4,walter,i spoke with junior on the phone and after much discussion he agreed to swing by tomorrow pick up some clothes
5,4,walter,and so voila the kids are out of this environment
5,4,walter,what a coincidence
5,4,walter,i know youre awake
5,4,walter,what was that about
5,4,skyler,can you explain it
5,4,skyler,i dont want the children here anymore
5,4,skyler,it isnt safe
5,4,walter,skyler we have talked about this repeatedly
5,4,skyler,it has never been more safe
5,4,walter,never been
5,4,walter,a couple weeks ago a man was coming to this house to kll us to mrder your entire family
5,4,walter,you were in the crawlspace screaming
5,4,skyler,and i dealt with him
5,4,walter,its over
5,4,skyler,it is not
5,4,walter,youre right back in the meth business again
5,4,walter,this is different
5,4,walter,now im running things
5,4,skyler,so wait
5,4,walter,now that youre in charge its what its gonna be smooth sailing from here on out
5,4,skyler,i dont see why not
5,4,walter,i keep the work at work skyler and nothing will ever impact you or the kids
5,4,walter,you dont know that
5,4,skyler,you cant make that promise walt
5,4,skyler,i can promise you that gus fring is dead
5,4,walter,and he was the threat
5,4,walter,he was the danger
5,4,skyler,i thought you were the danger
5,4,walter,is that what your pool stunt was about
5,4,skyler,trying to protect my children from me
5,4,skyler,not just you theres blood on my hands too
5,4,walter,what blood
5,4,walter,beneke
5,4,skyler,hes in the hospital because of me
5,4,skyler,because of what i did
5,4,walter,skyler you cant beat yourself up over this thing
5,4,walter,please
5,4,walter,you didnt set out to hurt anybody
5,4,walter,you made a mistake and things got out of control but you did what you had to do to protect your family
5,4,walter,and im sorry
5,4,walter,that doesnt make you a bad person it makes you a human being
5,4,skyler,stop it walt
5,4,skyler,just stop
5,4,skyler,i dont need to hear any of your bullshit rationales
5,4,skyler,im in it now
5,4,skyler,im compromised
5,4,skyler,but i wont i will not have my children living in a house where dealing drgs and hurting people and klling people is shrugged off as shit happens
5,4,skyler, were back at it
5,4,skyler,fine
5,4,skyler,but the kids stay away and thats that
5,4,skyler,thats that
5,4,walter,thats what
5,4,skyler,i got them out of this house
5,4,walter,to a sleepover at their aunt and uncles
5,4,walter,they spend a day or two junior stays up late watching movies and then what happens
5,4,skyler, well see
5,4,walter,no ill tell you what happens
5,4,walter,they come home
5,4,walter,to this house
5,4,walter,to their parents who love them
5,4,skyler,i will not let our business endanger them
5,4,walter,how many times do i have to say that they are not in  i said no
5,4,skyler,i swear to god i wont have them back here
5,4,walter,what are you gonna do to stop it
5,4,skyler,whatever it takes
5,4,skyler,everything in my power
5,4,walter,like what
5,4,walter,i mean specificly
5,4,walter,what is your next move
5,4,skyler,my next move is maybe i hurt myself
5,4,skyler,make it clear we need more time
5,4,skyler,let hank and marie see were still struggling
5,4,walter,no more like youre still struggling
5,4,walter,so maybe next time i have you committed
5,4,walter,put you in some inpatient facility while i take care of the kids myself
5,4,walter,is that what you want
5,4,skyler,so then maybe i show up with bruises on my neck give myself a black eye say that you beat me when you found out about my lover
5,4,walter,i see
5,4,skyler,so you want to involve ted
5,4,walter,oh well thatll be fun bringing the police up to speed on all of that
5,4,walter,but not as much fun as telling your 16yearold son that his father is a wifebeater
5,4,walter,also not a very good plan
5,4,walter,what else you got
5,4,skyler,i could send junior away to school
5,4,walter,now heres the conversation so honey i know youve only got one year left in high school but i would love it so much if you would drop everything leave all your friends behind and go to boarding school in arizona
5,4,walter, you have any other ideas
5,4,walter,because im not hearing a solution to your problem
5,4,walter,how are you going to save our kids from this terrible environment
5,4,walter, i  what are you gonna do
5,4,walter,are you gonna run off to france
5,4,walter,are you gonna close the curtains change the locks
5,4,walter,this is a joke
5,4,walter,come on skyler
5,4,walter,you wanna take me on
5,4,walter,you wanna take away my children
5,4,walter, whats the plan
5,4,skyler, i dont know
5,4,skyler,this is the best i could come up with okay
5,4,skyler,i i will count every minute that the kids are away from here away from you as a victory
5,4,walter,but youre right
5,4,skyler,its a bad plan
5,4,skyler,i dont have any of your magic walt
5,4,skyler,i dont know what to do
5,4,skyler,im a coward
5,4,skyler,i i cant go to the police
5,4,skyler,i cant stop laundering your money
5,4,skyler,i cant keep you out of this house
5,4,skyler,i cant even keep you out of my bed
5,4,skyler,all i can do is wait
5,4,skyler,thats it
5,4,skyler,thats the only good option
5,4,skyler,hold on bide my time and wait
5,4,walter,wait for what
5,4,walter,what are you waiting for
5,4,skyler,for the cancer to come back
5,4,walter,yeah
5,4,skyler,okay
5,4,skyler,okay
5,4,skyler,just relax
5,4,skyler,im coming
5,4,skyler,look at that
5,4,skyler,you tell me what that looks like
5,4,walter,if the deas tracking her barrels there goes our precursor connection
5,4,skyler,thats done
5,4,skyler,and im telling you these days chances of getting a new methylamine hookup is rare man
5,4,walter,its like bigfoot
5,4,walter,like unicornrare
5,4,walter,kid its just youre giving me heartburn here
5,4,walter,gps on the bottom of the barrel
5,4,walter,why didnt they put it inside where nobody would see it
5,4,skyler,look its inside it gets wet
5,4,walter,they made these things to put under cars
5,4,skyler,they can get wet
5,4,skyler,even by cop standards this is sloppy
5,4,walter,and the other barrels they have trackers on the outside too
5,4,skyler,i dont know
5,4,walter,probably
5,4,skyler,you didnt check any of the other barrels
5,4,skyler, no
5,4,walter,but thats the only one we couldve taken according to her
5,4,walter,once we spotted it she freaked out i put the barrel back and we fod
5,4,walter,let me ask you something
5,4,walter,the person who spotted this was it you or was it her
5,4,walter,she saw it first
5,4,skyler,okay
5,4,walter,shes dead
5,4,skyler,wait wait wait
5,4,walter,what
5,4,walter,lydia planted this thing not the cops
5,4,walter,shes thinking if she makes it look like her inventorys being watched that well leave her alone and take our business elsewhere
5,4,walter,and shes right we will be taking our business elsewhere right after i leave her alone in a ditch
5,4,walter,but wait hey if the deas not tracking her stuff thats a good thing right
5,4,walter,i mean all we gotta do is tell her to you know cut the crap and keep the methylamine coming
5,4,walter,you dont know this woman like i do
5,4,skyler,i had a chance to deal with this before and i gave her a pass
5,4,skyler,thats what i get for being sexist
5,4,skyler,now if youll excuse me mike you cant just look thats our precursor
5,4,walter,we need her
5,4,walter,kid if we have to ramp down for a while so be it
5,4,skyler,it beats working with a lunatic whos gonna get us arrested or klled
5,4,walter,look she didnt seem crazy to me you know
5,4,walter,she just seemed like uptight
5,4,walter,and now youre being sexist
5,4,walter,trust me this woman deserves to die as much as any man ive ever met
5,4,skyler,wait
5,4,skyler,just wait
5,4,walter,what if this really was the cops you know
5,4,walter, and what if youre wrong about her
5,4,walter, im not wrong
5,4,walter,but what if you are
5,4,walter,jesse your misgivings have been duly noted
5,4,skyler,now move away from me
5,4,skyler,this is a voting thing

5,5,skyler,ii guess youd call it that
5,5,skyler,im certainly no expert but it it looks to me like some kind of a a tracking device or or a gps
5,5,mike,so i was just wondering if maybe your people put it there
5,5,skyler,not that its any of my business but the last thing i wanna do is interfere with a law enforcement operation or a sting or whatever you call it
5,5,mike,so i dont know
5,5,skyler,maybe you could give me some guidance

5,5,mike,okay great
5,5,todd,thanks for the call ms
5,5,skyler,hey gomie come here would ya
5,5,jesse, yeah
5,5,mike, hey man
5,5,mike,you dont know anything about gps trackers on a methylamine barrel do you
5,5,mike,madrigal houston im talking about
5,5,walter jr,nobody from my team planted anything
5,5,todd,why
5,5,mike,oh i dont know
5,5,walter,i figured as much
5,5,mike,all right
5,5,jesse,thanks
5,5,mike,ii know what youre thinking but i didnt do it
5,5,skyler,im telling you i didnt plant that thing
5,5,mike,shut up
5,5,mike,and there you have it like i said
5,5,mike,all right
5,5,skyler,so now what
5,5,skyler,its not the deas so schraders probably thinking some crew planted it looking for a weak spot to pull a heist
5,5,mike,hes gonna send a team over to that warehouse
5,5,todd,hes gonna wire it out the wazoo bugs cameras the whole nine yards
5,5,todd,so the warehouse is too hot
5,5,jesse,her supply is useless to us now
5,5,jesse,it depends on how fast schrader can get his guys there
5,5,skyler,were 900 miles closer after all
5,5,mike,i say we keep listening suss out how much time we have
5,5,mike,if its at least 12 hours then we head down there use her security code to gain access and we take every barrel we can get our hands on
5,5,mike,uhaul can only take six or seven before the suspension gives out
5,5,mike,its a stopgap
5,5,todd,but right now its the best we can do
5,5,mike,well what about her
5,5,mike,you two drive the barrels back tonight
5,5,mike,ill deal with her
5,5,mike,no no no
5,5,mike,youre making a mistake
5,5,todd,this this was not me
5,5,mike,i swear to god i didnt do it
5,5,mike,i dont know man
5,5,mike,it sounds like shes telling the truth to me
5,5,mike,she has a gn to her head kid
5,5,mike,everyone sounds like meryl streep with a gn to their head
5,5,walter,im sorry jesse
5,5,mike,youre the one who wanted to put it up to a vote
5,5,skyler,its two against one
5,5,skyler,you cant kll me
5,5,skyler,come on
5,5,mike,i swear i didnt do anything
5,5,mike,hey janice give me doughty in the houston office will you
5,5,mike,you got it
5,5,todd,hes on the line
5,5,mike,hey erol
5,5,mike,please tell me you guys didnt do something as lamebrained as put a gps tracker on the outside of a barrel of methylamine one earmarked for the madrigal warehouse in houston
5,5,mike,uh whos asking
5,5,mike,did someone find them
5,5,mike,jesus
5,5,mike,are you sh1tting me
5,5,mike,since when do you put a gps tracker on the outside of a barrel
5,5,mike,we didnt have time to go in there with hazard suits hank
5,5,mike,they were about to ship
5,5,todd,we epoxied them to the bottom
5,5,todd,they were wellhidden
5,5,mike,oh really
5,5,mike,well not wellhidden enough
5,5,mike,how many barrels you tag
5,5,mike,all of them
5,5,mike,all the ones that were headed to the warehouse anyway
5,5,skyler,christ
5,5,mike,all right
5,5,todd,well sit tight
5,5,mike,let me figure out how to play this
5,5,skyler,next time a little communication first all right
5,5,skyler,yeah i im sorry about that
5,5,mike,asshole
5,5,skyler,aside aside from the fact that we almost klled this woman all of those barrels are already marked
5,5,mike,we solve the problem we can
5,5,todd,this has not changed the equation one iota for her
5,5,skyler,oh come on
5,5,skyler,you are not seriously still considering klling me
5,5,walter,i saved you
5,5,skyler,if it werent for me wed all be in jail right now
5,5,mike,i hate to say it but shes shes right mike
5,5,skyler,she saved our asses by finding that thing
5,5,skyler,she was saving herself
5,5,skyler,shes a loose cannon
5,5,skyler,i am telling you she will turn a gn or a badge on us the first chance she gets
5,5,mike,the woman put a hit out on me
5,5,walter jr,seriously
5,5,mike,a hit
5,5,skyler,what
5,5,mike,like the mafia
5,5,mike,yeah like the mafia
5,5,mike,hey
5,5,skyler,you still need methylamine dont you
5,5,mike,right
5,5,todd,you wanna talk methylamine
5,5,mike,then tell your partner to stop threatening me and lets talk
5,5,skyler,talk about what
5,5,mike,you heard
5,5,skyler,you cant even get us a single barrel
5,5,mike,who said anything about barrels
5,5,mike,im talking about an ocean of the stuff
5,5,skyler,just give him a minute would you
5,5,mike,trust him
5,5,mike,trust him
5,5,mike,so lets hear it
5,5,mike,not without a guarantee that once i tell you how to get what you want i wont be klled anyway
5,5,mike,fine
5,5,mike,you have my word
5,5,walter,not good enough
5,5,mike,look lady do you have children
5,5,mike,that has nothing to do with this
5,5,todd,its not a trick question
5,5,mike,why dont you just answer it
5,5,skyler,yes i have children
5,5,skyler,so what
5,5,skyler,you think that somehow because were both parents that i wont let my partner do whats necessary
5,5,mike,swear on their lives
5,5,skyler,oh what
5,5,skyler,swear on your childrens lives that i wont be harmed
5,5,mike,otherwise how can i trust you
5,5,mike,look youre a smart businesswoman
5,5,mike,you understand the concept of leverage
5,5,walter,please dont patronize me
5,5,skyler,i hate that
5,5,walter jr,you have none
5,5,mike,but trust has to work both ways lydia
5,5,mike,is it true that you put a hit out on mike
5,5,todd,yes
5,5,todd,why
5,5,mike, i was scared
5,5,walter jr,of mike
5,5,mike,not at first
5,5,skyler,there are men who used to work with gus fring in custody right now
5,5,mike,nine of them
5,5,skyler,they know everything about me
5,5,mike,everything
5,5,skyler,some of them even know about you assuming youre the master chemist theyre always talking about
5,5,mike,and if its these nine that youre worried about why put the hit on mike
5,5,walter jr,i had no choice
5,5,mike,im not going to prison and have my daughter raised in some horrible group home
5,5,skyler,do you have any idea what those places are like
5,5,mike,i gave him a list of names but instead of handling it hes protecting them
5,5,walter,so i hired someone else
5,5,mike,at that point there was no option but to add mike to the list
5,5,skyler,this ocean of methylamine that you claim you can get your hands on how much are we talking about literally
5,5,mike,how does 24000 gallons sound
5,5,skyler,once a week on a wednesday a freight train leaves the port of long beach loaded with industrial chemicals
5,5,todd,theres always at least one tanker car full of methylamine which we import from a manufacturer in guangzhou
5,5,mike,the train travels east through arizona stops at a rail yard outside flagstaff where it gets broken down and rebuilt
5,5,todd,but the methylamine always moves on destined for our pesticide concerns in texas and oklahoma
5,5,skyler,which means that it passes right through your home state
5,5,mike,theres a remote threemile stretch here in mckinley county
5,5,skyler,thats where you do it
5,5,skyler,thats where we do what exactly
5,5,todd,get your methylamine
5,5,skyler,like rob it
5,5,walter,like jesse james
5,5,todd,you want the stuff
5,5,mike,im offering you enough to fill a swimming pool
5,5,mike,you are offering us a quick trip to prison
5,5,skyler,thats what im hearing
5,5,jesse,stopping a train post 911
5,5,mike,you have any idea how many alarms thats gonna set off between here and d
5,5,mike,none if you do it right here
5,5,mike,if a freight train is stopped in transit anywhere other than the usual yards or depots absolutely a signal will automatically alarm the fra and the tsa surface division at the department of homeland security
5,5,mike,but what you dont know and i do because my job requires me to keep track of my buyers shipments this is dark territory
5,5,skyler,whats that
5,5,mike, trainspeak for an area of no contact
5,5,skyler,its a dead zone
5,5,skyler,no automated supervision system no alarms no contact with control
5,5,skyler,what about cell phones
5,5,skyler, crew could just call the cops
5,5,mike,no cellular either
5,5,mike,im telling you its the perfect place
5,5,mike,youd have time enough to stop the train siphon off as much methylamine as you can carry and get away before the police wait a minute
5,5,skyler,wait a minute
5,5,mike,assuming we can stop a moving train how do we know we have the right one
5,5,todd,and which tanker car is which
5,5,skyler,i cant believe that they would advertise their contents
5,5,mike,once the train gets rebuilt in flagstaff a final manifest gets uploaded to my companys server
5,5,mike,ill have it for you sometime between midnight and 200 a
5,5,skyler,thatll give you at least six hours of lead time
5,5,mike,keep in mind im taking a huge risk supplying this information
5,5,skyler,i expect to be paid
5,5,jesse,wwe can talk percentages later
5,5,skyler,you know what this means dont you
5,5,mike,weve gotta off the crew
5,5,mike,how do you figure
5,5,mike,well if we dont the engineers gonna call the cops as soon as he gets out of the dead zone
5,5,skyler,its only three miles long
5,5,todd,but were way out in the boonies
5,5,mike,i dont care if its in the gobi desert
5,5,mike,once they get word the fbi and homeland security are gonna swoop down with choppers on us so fast itll make our heads spin
5,5,skyler,and there is no hiding in that open country
5,5,mike,how many in the crew
5,5,skyler, just two an engineer and a conductor
5,5,skyler,assuming there are no security guards
5,5,walter,no guards
5,5,mike,its not like were carrying nuclear warheads
5,5,mike,two guys
5,5,skyler,cant we just tie them up or something
5,5,mike,and then what
5,5,mike,even if we wear a mask were leaving two witnesses behind
5,5,skyler,bottom line i have done this long enough to know that there are two kinds of heists those where the guys get away with it and those that leave witnesses
5,5,skyler,give me a break
5,5,mike,you guys were gonna mrder me
5,5,mike,i thought you were professionals
5,5,skyler,can you say asac
5,5,skyler, can you say that
5,5,mike,say asac schrader
5,5,mike, if those turn out to be her first words i will beat you with my shoe
5,5,mike,dont listen to him holly
5,5,mike,aw im just telling it like it is babe
5,5,mike,boss man
5,5,mike,im the boss man
5,5,mike,say boss man
5,5,mike, am i the boss man
5,5,todd,im the boss
5,5,skyler,hey that better be something from a boob instead of some fake soy crap
5,5,jesse,yeah yeah
5,5,mike,my little girl  your little girl
5,5,mike,deserves the real mccoy
5,5,mike,oh no
5,5,mike,see
5,5,todd,she doesnt want it
5,5,todd,no she wants me
5,5,todd,she wants me
5,5,mike,yeah my little girl cause im not giving her back
5,5,mike,yeah i know
5,5,skyler,what about emo mcgee
5,5,mike,has he come out of his room today
5,5,walter,barely
5,5,mike,when he does he barely talks
5,5,skyler,yeah well what do you expect you know
5,5,mike,his parents treat him like hes a baby there
5,5,skyler,flynn do you want me to heat up some of that lasagna to hold you over till dinner
5,5,mike,hey i picked up heat on bluray
5,5,todd,wanna watch it with me later
5,5,skyler,and you can keep talking about me now
5,5,mike,well if no one else is gonna offer an opinion i will
5,5,todd,we do it the oldfashioned way
5,5,mike,we hit skid row the crystal palace all the halfway houses scrounge up about a dozen skells and put them to work smurfing cold pills
5,5,skyler,you mean switch back to a pseudo cook
5,5,mike,youre the chemist
5,5,mike,admittedly its gonna cut down on our output
5,5,mike,like a factor of four or five
5,5,skyler,it also means that we will eat 80000 we just invested in our new lab equipment which is only good for a p2p cook
5,5,mike,you know i dont have to do the math to know that wed be making a fraction of the profit
5,5,mike,and making less money is better than making nothing
5,5,jesse,oh yeah mike
5,5,todd,well why dont you tell us why
5,5,mike,why is making nothing not an option
5,5,skyler, walter  let me tell you why
5,5,walter,its because of your nine guys in lockup right
5,5,mike,you broke it you pay for it
5,5,mike,and weve talked about this plenty already
5,5,mike,well maybe we better talk about it a little more because what it sounds like youre telling me mike is that from now on we have no choice but to do this piddling pseudo cook so that we can pay back your guys
5,5,skyler,or else what
5,5,mike,or else theyre gonna rat on us and we end up in prison
5,5,jesse,yeah
5,5,mike,and it sounds like what youre telling me walter is that you wanna do this heist even if it means klling a couple of innocent men
5,5,skyler,that what you want
5,5,mike,you know i dont know why you insist on putting words in my mouth here
5,5,jesse,what if we can rip off that train and no one ever knows it got robbed
5,5,skyler,maybe just maybe
5,5,skyler,itll come from that direction
5,5,skyler,wait a minute
5,5,mike,its perfect
5,5,mike,yeah we do it here
5,5,mike,we do it right here
5,5,skyler,how are we looking mike
5,5,skyler,all clear
5,5,skyler,copy that
5,5,mike,go down go down
5,5,mike,all right
5,5,mike,thats good fernando
5,5,mike,all right
5,5,todd,this one
5,5,mike,whoo
5,5,mike,you good
5,5,jesse, yeah
5,5,skyler,whats your name again
5,5,mike, todd
5,5,mike,todd on the day are you gonna be able to make this climb
5,5,todd,yes sir
5,5,skyler,ill be ready
5,5,mike,all right
5,5,todd,you mind if i ask you a question
5,5,walter,go ahead
5,5,todd,well i get why we want the tnk for the methylamine
5,5,todd,but why this other one for the water
5,5,walter,well jesse its your idea
5,5,walter,you wanna fill him in
5,5,jesse,its all about the weight yo
5,5,mike,the tanker were gonna hit it gets weighed once when it gets loaded in long beach and then again when its unloaded in texas
5,5,mike,if the weights dont match the train companys gonna know it got robbed
5,5,jesse,boosting methylamine from a train is like a major rap
5,5,jesse,the point is no one other than us can ever know that this robbery went down
5,5,jesse,nobody
5,5,mike,you got it
5,5,jesse,yeah
5,5,todd,absolutely
5,5,walter,are you sure
5,5,todd,yes sir
5,5,todd,with all that said the whole thing relies on us replacing the weight of methylamine we steal with the same weight in water
5,5,mike,right on
5,5,todd,so theyll never know we hit them
5,5,todd,aqueous methylamine is waterbased yet it weighs slightly less than water
5,5,skyler,so we will be removing a thousand gallons of methylamine from the tanker car but replacing it with about ninetenths of that volume in water which comes to actually jesse lets make that an even 920 to account for spillage and whatever will remain in the hose
5,5,todd,how we doing by the way
5,5,mike,were almost there
5,5,mike,all right
5,5,todd,but wont they figure out they got robbed anyway on account of getting watereddown methylamine
5,5,mike,well out of 24000 gallons itll only amount to about four percent dilution so but yes youre right
5,5,skyler,they will notice
5,5,skyler,at which point they will blame china for sending a marginally weaker batch
5,5,skyler,damn you guys thought of everything
5,5,skyler,flynn flynn open the door
5,5,skyler,just come out and talk to me
5,5,walter jr,im staying
5,5,walter jr,thats all i have to say
5,5,mike,whats going on
5,5,skyler,you got what you wanted thats what
5,5,skyler,congratulations
5,5,walter,its me
5,5,walter,open up
5,5,skyler,come on junior
5,5,walter,im not gonna ask twice
5,5,skyler,what

5,5,walter jr,why do i have to go to uncle hanks
5,5,walter jr,give me the exact reason or im not going anywhere
5,5,walter,this is not gonna be a debate
5,5,mike,whats going on
5,5,walter jr,why cant anybody tell me anything
5,5,walter jr,i want one good reason
5,5,walter,because were your parents and youre our child
5,5,walter,thats reason enough
5,5,walter,now please do as i ask
5,5,mike,now
5,5,mike,itll pass
5,5,skyler,hell understand
5,5,mike,dont start walt
5,5,skyler,i wont change my mind about you
5,5,mike,ever
5,5,walter,well i dont accept that
5,5,walter,youre my wife
5,5,skyler,im not your wife im your hostage
5,5,skyler,but since you insist on keeping me imprisoned ill make you a deal
5,5,skyler,i will launder your money ill keep your secrets but the kids will stay at hank and maries where they have a chance of being safe
5,5,walter,think youve seen too many movies
5,5,walter,our children are not in danger
5,5,skyler,just a couple of days ago you told me that a man held a gn to your head
5,5,skyler,you said it like it was a point of pride
5,5,skyler,theres nothing you can say thatll convince me there wont come a day that somebody will knock on that door looking to harm you or me or all of us
5,5,skyler,and when that day comes the children cannot be here
5,5,skyler,you agree to that and i will be whatever kind of partner you want me to be

5,6,saul,you agree to that and i will be whatever kind of partner you want me to be
5,6,saul,legacy cost
5,6,saul,it should come out of your end
5,6,saul,no one can ever know that this robbery went down
5,6,hank,absolutely
5,6,mike,you guys didnt tell me this stuff smells like cat piss
5,6,jesse,man
5,6,walter,shit happens huh
5,6,saul,i mean im sorry but i had to do it
5,6,saul,obviously i guess you see it different
5,6,walter,some of you
5,6,saul,but i didnt see any other choice
5,6,saul,ive been thinking about this all day going over and over it in my head and it was the only way
5,6,jesse,well its not like i wanted to
5,6,walter,the kid was on a dirt bike
5,6,saul,i mean he couldve just he couldve just gunned it and been gone before we even had a chance to blink
5,6,mike,we never wouldve been able to catch him
5,6,mike,i was thinking on my feet
5,6,mike,i saw a threat and i took care of it the only way that i could
5,6,walter,a threat
5,6,walter,the kid was waving at us
5,6,walter,he wasnt going anywhere
5,6,walter,he was saying hi
5,6,saul,yeah but you dont know that
5,6,walter,yeah i do
5,6,saul,he didnt know what hed seen
5,6,saul,well i didnt want to take that chance
5,6,mike,i the whole point of this thing was that no one was supposed know that we were even there right
5,6,saul,people werent ever supposed to know that anything got robbed
5,6,hank,how could we have let the kid go
5,6,walter,he made us
5,6,saul,if i hadnt done what i did the whole mission wouldve failed
5,6,jesse,im im real sorry
5,6,saul,i really am but i but did i make a mistake
5,6,jesse,white
5,6,mike,cause to me you know respectfully i was looking out for the team
5,6,saul,i didnt want to kll him
5,6,jesse,you gotta believe that
5,6,mike,at the end of the day it was him or us and i chose us
5,6,saul,and i would do it again
5,6,walter,okay look
5,6,saul,uh todd why dont you step outside for a few minutes so we can talk this through
5,6,walter,of course
5,6,saul,yeah you guys talk
5,6,saul,but i just want to make sure that you know that my priority is this business
5,6,walter,okay
5,6,saul,thats thats fine todd
5,6,saul,thank you
5,6,mike,i want to be a real part of this
5,6,jesse,all right
5,6,saul,if you could just see that
5,6,walter,im motivated
5,6,jesse,and ive got connections
5,6,jesse,yeah
5,6,walter,my uncles got his hookups in prison who i think could be a real help to us if okay
5,6,walter,that dude
5,6,walter,whackjob
5,6,saul,lets just stick to the facts here
5,6,walter,facts
5,6,walter,oh okay
5,6,saul,uh how about the fact that he shot a kid
5,6,mike,a kid that he didnt need to sht
5,6,walter,the boy had seen us
5,6,saul,and no it didnt look like he knew what he was seeing
5,6,saul,but what if he told somebody
5,6,saul,what if he just mentioned it in passing
5,6,saul,we cant know what someone exactly
5,6,jesse,we cant know because ricky hitler there shot him
5,6,saul,we us three shouldve had a discussion about it
5,6,saul,we wouldve figured it out
5,6,saul,but that dickhead just went ahead and made the choice for us
5,6,walter,is that how we do business now
5,6,jesse,look i understand youre upset
5,6,saul,and what was that crap about his uncle with the with the prison connections
5,6,saul,its just some bullshit intimidation move
5,6,saul,come on
5,6,saul,its true though
5,6,saul,he does have some connections
5,6,jesse,is this a problem
5,6,saul,its nothing to be concerned about
5,6,mike,it came up in the background i did on him
5,6,hank,didnt worry me then
5,6,saul,hes just flexing
5,6,jesse,all right
5,6,saul,it seems to me that we have three options here and none of which are ideal
5,6,walter,one we fire todd
5,6,jesse,yeah
5,6,saul,im not a fan of this option seeing that he knows way too much about this business at this point
5,6,saul,and wed most likely have to pay him to keep quiet
5,6,mike,and god only knows weve got enough of that going on
5,6,hank,two we dispose of him
5,6,walter,which leaves us option three
5,6,saul,we keep him on payroll
5,6,saul,put him back on tenting houses setting up the lab and so forth
5,6,skyler,we keep him close
5,6,walter,under our control
5,6,hank,now option three would be my choice
5,6,walter,shall we vote
5,6,walter,i vote three kid
5,6,walter,youre still in
5,6,walter,right on
5,6,saul,thank you so much
5,6,saul,you guys totally made the right the next time you bring a gn to a job without telling me i will stick it up your ass sideways

5,6,saul,hell ive even thought of you know i mean not seriously but i totally get your temptation

5,6,saul,doesnt it feel good to get it off your chest
5,6,jesse,oh yeah
5,6,walter,i feel better
5,6,jesse,yeah
5,6,mike,for those who love the taste but not the price theres simulated caviar made of kelp a type of seaweed
5,6,mike,a fraction of the cost it looks smells and tastes similar to the real thing
5,6,saul,ready to get back at it
5,6,walter,unlike fish caviar we have breaking news into our newsroom
5,6,saul,weve just learned that police are now expanding their search for a missing mckinley county boy after four days with no leads
5,6,saul,fourteenyearold drew sharp was last seen by his parents thursday morning
5,6,mike,authorities are extending their search today east from crownpoint to hospah and white horse
5,6,mike,sharp was last seen riding his dirt bike into the desert behind his house
5,6,mike,investigators are asking any jesse nothing can change this
5,6,jesse,yeah
5,6,saul,its just that kids parents i know
5,6,walter,believe me
5,6,mike,i havent been able to sleep the past few nights just thinking about it
5,6,saul,but jesse now finally were selfsufficient
5,6,saul,finally we have everything that we need and no one to answer to except ourselves
5,6,saul,and in a year year and a half once weve cooked through this methylamine and made our money there will be plenty of time for soulsearching
5,6,walter,until then we keep going
5,6,mike,and we we run our business our way and make sure that this never happens again
5,6,walter,okay
5,6,walter,look
5,6,mike,listen ill ill finish this up
5,6,saul,why dont why dont you go on home
5,6,jesse, you sure
5,6,skyler, absolutely
5,6,jesse,yeah
5,6,mike,ill take care of this
5,6,jesse,you go on
5,6,skyler,hey

5,6,saul,come in
5,6,mike,join us
5,6,skyler,hey
5,6,saul,wheres your cars
5,6,saul,we parked around the block
5,6,mike,you might consider doing that as well
5,6,walter,okay
5,6,jesse,so whats going on
5,6,mike,just since this morning i threw three separate tails
5,6,mike,all dea
5,6,walter,what
5,6,saul, the feds have been all over me
5,6,saul,this has been going on for a while now
5,6,saul,did they follow you here
5,6,mike,i said i threw them
5,6,hank,i would never come to the headquarters of our illegal meth operation dragging a bunch of cops walter
5,6,hank,it would be unwise
5,6,saul,how can you be so sure
5,6,saul,well ive been doing this a long time
5,6,jesse,its pretty basic stuff
5,6,walter,how long has this been going on
5,6,mike,since about the time we started this little venture
5,6,saul,the dea in particular your peach of a brotherinlaw has taken a keen interest in my activities
5,6,saul,and youre just telling me this now
5,6,saul,what you didnt think this information would be of interest
5,6,hank,wouldnt be germane
5,6,saul,ive been handling it walter
5,6,jesse,were sitting on a thousand gallons of stolen methylamine
5,6,walter,jesus
5,6,saul,how can you be so irresponsible
5,6,hank,calm down would you please
5,6,mike,i cant believe that you kept this from me
5,6,skyler,from us
5,6,saul,did you know about this
5,6,jesse,mike just told me
5,6,saul,and i said calm down
5,6,saul,ive got it under control
5,6,walter,oh well forgive me for not having complete confidence
5,6,jesse,you know this cant go on right
5,6,saul,yeah i know
5,6,walter,and ive already decided
5,6,jesse,im out
5,6,walter,okay
5,6,jesse,well sorry to see you go mike
5,6,saul,but i really dont see any other way
5,6,hank,neither do i
5,6,mike,obviously jesse youll have to take over the distribution end of things
5,6,mike,mike i trust that youll bring jesse up to speed on your side of the business
5,6,jesse,yeah
5,6,saul,um about that
5,6,walter,actually mr
5,6,saul,white um im out too
5,6,saul,youre what
5,6,mike,i dont think i can do this anymore
5,6,walter,so um im retiring i guess
5,6,saul,that methylamine that we stole that we nearly klled ourselves trying to steal that methylamine when cooked is worth nearly 300 million
5,6,mike,and youre telling me that youre willing to walk away from that
5,6,mike,were walking away from the meth
5,6,walter,not the methylamine
5,6,jesse,jesse and i will be taking our twothirds and were selling it
5,6,saul,ive got a connection a guy i knew from my time with fring
5,6,saul,this guy has the capital and hes motivated
5,6,walter,highly
5,6,jesse,mikes thinking well clear like five million
5,6,jesse,each
5,6,walter,ill pay off my guys in lockup out of my share
5,6,saul,and those legacy costs that youre so fond of you wont have to worry about anymore
5,6,jesse,and then i will be going on my way
5,6,walter,jesse too
5,6,gomez,its a solid plan
5,6,saul,you can come in on this with us
5,6,hank,thatd be cool
5,6,saul,course you know you are free to hold onto your third and keep cooking
5,6,walter,youll be selling to my competitors
5,6,saul,this guy and his crew are way out in phoenix
5,6,saul,its a big country walter
5,6,walter,whole lot of methheads
5,6,walter,pennies on the dollar jesse
5,6,saul,and thats what youre gonna sell out for
5,6,walter,pennies
5,6,mike,five million isnt pennies
5,6,walter,its more money than ive ever seen
5,6,walter,and when it comes down to it are we in the meth business
5,6,walter,or the money business
5,6,walter,relax kid
5,6,mike,theres no one there
5,6,jesse,you sure
5,6,walter,i wouldnt be here if i wasnt
5,6,jesse,glad to see you could make it out
5,6,jesse,i was surprised to get your call
5,6,jesse,good surprise i hope
5,6,saul,theres one gallon as discussed
5,6,saul,you take that back home to your people test it
5,6,mike,if youre satisfied i can get the other 665
5,6,jesse,all right
5,6,walter,thats fair enough
5,6,walter,shall we talk money
5,6,walter,that ones free
5,6,mike,the price for the rest is 15000 per although i would prefer you round it up to ten
5,6,saul,makes it easier for my partner and i to split
5,6,saul,steep
5,6,jesse,we good
5,6,jesse,yeah
5,6,mike,ill talk to my guys but i should be able to put together that cash yeah
5,6,jesse,good
5,6,mike,i gotta tell you this is worth it just to get that blue stuff of yours off the market
5,6,hank,the blue stuff will be off the market right
5,6,mike,now this whole time i was thinking 666 that seems like an odd number
5,6,saul,twothirds of an even thousand though
5,6,saul,when i look at it that way it starts to make sense to me
5,6,saul,thats not all the methylamine is it
5,6,saul,you two have a partner you havent mentioned
5,6,hank,this other party wouldnt be a problem for you
5,6,saul,his territory wont impact yours
5,6,saul,you see that doesnt work for me
5,6,mike,im not just buying this for the supply
5,6,saul,im buying this for the demand
5,6,saul,im looking to increase my market share here mike
5,6,saul,well i dont know what to tell you
5,6,mike,i want you to tell me that frings blue will be off the streets
5,6,jesse,all right
5,6,saul,heres a new deal for you then
5,6,jesse,ill pay you 15k a gallon for the full thousand gallons
5,6,saul,not a drop less
5,6,walter,its not mine to sell declan
5,6,jesse,well then no deal mike
5,6,walter,i guess
5,6,saul,i dont know
5,6,saul,why dont you come over here
5,6,walter,to my house
5,6,jesse,yes seriously
5,6,skyler,hey
5,6,mike,yo you sure this is okay
5,6,saul,shes not here
5,6,saul,nobodys here
5,6,jesse,all right
5,6,jesse,so uh somethings come up
5,6,saul,mike wanted to come here to give you the hard sell but i figured itd be better coming from me
5,6,jesse,mikes connection wont buy mine and mikes shares of the methylamine unless he gets your share too
5,6,mike,he wants the entire thousand gallons
5,6,saul,absolutely not
5,6,saul,yeah i figured youd say that
5,6,saul,but ive been thinking about it and it really makes sense
5,6,gomez,kinda
5,6,hank,it does does it
5,6,saul,look when you uh when you started this thing did you ever dream of having 5 million
5,6,saul,i know for a fact that you didnt
5,6,saul,i know for a fact all you needed was was 737000 cause you worked it all out like mathematically
5,6,mike,look if selling the methylamine now means that no one else ever gets klled then i vote for that man
5,6,saul,hands down
5,6,jesse,and we could have it tomorrow
5,6,hank,we would be out
5,6,saul,you could spend time with your family
5,6,saul,no more worrying about them getting hurt or finding out about everything
5,6,saul,isnt this what youve been working for
5,6,mike,i have not been working this hard just to sell out
5,6,saul,its not selling out
5,6,saul,yes it is jesse
5,6,walter,i ha we have suffered and bled literally for this business
5,6,saul,and i will not throw it away for nothing
5,6,saul,i dont know how else to say it mr
5,6,jesse,white
5,6,walter,5 million isnt nothing
5,6,walter,jesse have you heard of a company called gray matter
5,6,saul, no
5,6,walter,well i cofounded it in grad school with a couple of friends of mine
5,6,walter,actually i was the one who named it
5,6,walter,and back then it was just oh it was just smalltime
5,6,walter,we had a couple patents pending
5,6,walter,but nothing earthshattering
5,6,walter,course we all knew the potential
5,6,jesse,yeah
5,6,walter,we were gonna take the world by storm
5,6,walter,and then this uh well something happened between the three of us
5,6,walter,and im not gonna go into detail
5,6,walter,but for personal reasons i decided to leave the company
5,6,walter,and i sold my share to my two partners
5,6,walter,i took a buyout for 5000
5,6,walter,now at the time that was a lot of money for me
5,6,walter,care to guess what that company is worth now
5,6,jesse,millions
5,6,saul,billions with a b
5,6,walter, as of last friday
5,6,walter,i look it up every week
5,6,walter,and i sold my share my potential for 5000
5,6,walter,i sold my kids birthright for a few months rent
5,6,jesse,this isnt the same thing
5,6,walter,jesse you asked me if i was in the meth business or the money business
5,6,walter,neither
5,6,walter,im in the empire business
5,6,saul,i dont know
5,6,jesse,white is a meth empire really something to be that proud of
5,6,walter,skyler you remember jesse

5,6,walter,theyre gone
5,6,walter,theyre staying with my inlaws
5,6,walter,she made me kick my own kids out of the house
5,6,walter,she told me that she was counting the days until my cancer came back
5,6,walter,my wife is waiting for me to die
5,6,walter,this business is all i have left now
5,6,walter,its all i have
5,6,walter,and you want to take it away from me
5,6,saul,i thought you might try something stupid
5,6,jesse,look mike  dont bother walter
5,6,mike,come join me in the office
5,6,walter,i dont think so
5,6,saul,thats not a request
5,6,mike,might as well get comfortable
5,6,mike,this deals going down tomorrow
5,6,mike,its happening and theres nothing you can do to stop it
5,6,saul,got it
5,6,mike, oh so its okay for you to steal my and to ensure that you and i are gonna spend the rest of the night together in this office
5,6,mike,like its my birthday
5,6,mike,mike when the deal is done youll get your money
5,6,mike,i guarantee that
5,6,walter,let me cook it
5,6,walter,ill double your five and you still walk
5,6,mike,you know i have never seen anybody work so hard not to get 5 million
5,6,walter,mike you need to listen to me
5,6,mike,no walter
5,6,mike,the last thing i need to do is listen to you
5,6,mike,now sit down
5,6,jesse,all right
5,6,saul,walter ive got a bit of a quandary here
5,6,mike,ive got something i need to attend to before this deal happens
5,6,walter,but for some reason i dont trust you alone with the methylamine
5,6,saul,im gonna have to restrain you
5,6,jesse,you gotta be kidding
5,6,jesse,stand up for me please
5,6,jesse,stand up
5,6,walter,turn around for me
5,6,mike,arms out to the side
5,6,jesse,oh man
5,6,mike,sit down
5,6,mike,sit down
5,6,walter,give me your wrist
5,6,saul,sorry
5,6,jesse,all righty
5,6,hank,to what do we owe the pleasure
5,6,saul,well gentlemen were here to discuss your illegal harassment of my client
5,6,hank,this should be good
5,6,saul,ehrmantraut has become the subject of a vicious relentless and unwarranted dea persecution
5,6,hank,gomie does that uh that sound right to you
5,6,gomez,i have no idea what hes talking about
5,6,saul,play it as cool as you like fonzie
5,6,saul,but we all know youve been following my client day and night
5,6,saul,the poor man cant even spend a few minutes with his granddaughter without you guys quivering in the bushes and peeping through your little binoculars
5,6,saul,its well its disturbing
5,6,saul,and its taken a toll on his mental and physical wellbeing
5,6,hank,your client looks fine to me
5,6,saul,well some hurts only show on the inside
5,6,saul,now you guys dont even have warrants for these tails do you
5,6,hank,theoretically these tails you refer to would be completely within the bounds of the law
5,6,gomez,we dont need a warrant to follow somebody through a public place
5,6,hank,theoretically
5,6,hank,yeah that is uh theoretically correct
5,6,saul,however i would counter that an openended unrestricted surveillance like this amounts to stalking
5,6,saul,which is illegal
5,6,saul,now i dont know what it is you find so interesting about my client and im not here to judge
5,6,saul,different strokes and all
5,6,saul,but sadly hes just not that into you
5,6,saul,so i have filed for a temporary restraining order against the dea on behalf of mr
5,6,saul,ehrmantraut
5,6,hank,whered you get your law degree goodman
5,6,hank,the same clown college you got that suit
5,6,saul,you know who likes this suit
5,6,saul,judge papadoumian
5,6,saul,she thinks im a snappy dresser
5,6,saul,you know what judge papadoumian hates
5,6,saul,police harassment of a senior citizen
5,6,saul,sorry
5,6,saul,expect a visit from the sheriff agents
5,6,saul,you should have your ex parte within the hour
5,6,jesse,lets go
5,6,mike,what the hell kind of judge would issue this thing
5,6,saul,papadoumian man
5,6,jesse,shes like ho chi minh
5,6,hank,so what we do
5,6,jesse,well not a lot of choice you know
5,6,walter,we back off
5,6,saul,for the moment
5,6,saul,tro wont stand up and goodman knows it
5,6,saul,i dont see what theyre playing at here but if ehrmantraut wants a fight hes gonna get one
5,6,walter,that was a hell of a gamble
5,6,jesse,worked
5,6,walter,yeah well not for long
5,6,saul,hes right about that tro
5,6,walter,its gonna get tossed toute suite
5,6,jesse,meanwhile schraders hardon for you just reached uncle miltie proportions
5,6,saul,so have fun with that
5,6,walter,how much time i got
5,6,saul,maybe 24 hours
5,6,saul,its enough
5,6,walter,it better be
5,6,jesse,whatever you got planned you best pull the ripcord while you still have a chance
5,6,saul,where is it
5,6,jesse, mike  mike
5,6,mike, get out of my way
5,6,mike,you sit down
5,6,jesse,mike
5,6,jesse,mike
5,6,jesse,hold on okay
5,6,mike, i am gonna count to three
5,6,jesse,whites got an idea
5,6,jesse,mike im serious
5,6,mike,one
5,6,walter,two
5,6,jesse,its a great idea
5,6,jesse,look you get your five million we both do and he gets his methylamine all right
5,6,jesse,just hear him out
5,6,mike,is that true walter
5,6,walter,everybody wins
5,6,jesse,top
5,7,walter,the methylamine jesse and i will be taking our two thirds and were selling it
5,7,walter,full thousand gallons not a drop less
5,7,walter,mikes connection wont buy unless he gets your share too
5,7,walter,absolutely not
5,7,declan,this deals going down but for some reason i dont trust you alone with the methylamine
5,7,walter,im gonna have to restrain you
5,7,walter,you get your five millions we both do and he gets his methylamine
5,7,walter,is that true walter
5,7,walter,everybody wins
5,7,declan,there
5,7,walter,thats them
5,7,mike,your play walter
5,7,walter,youre on your own
5,7,declan,looks like youre about 1000 gallons light here mike
5,7,declan,wheres the juice
5,7,walter,the methylamine isnt coming
5,7,walter,why is that
5,7,declan,and who the hell are you
5,7,walter,im the man whos keeping it
5,7,walter,what the hells this
5,7,declan,we had an agreement right
5,7,declan,we got our deal
5,7,declan,so wheres the tnk mike
5,7,walter,mike doesnt know where it is
5,7,walter,only i do
5,7,walter,and youre dealing with me now not him
5,7,declan,why dont you just cut to what it is you want or what you think is gonna happen here all right
5,7,declan,cause were gonna get what we came for
5,7,walter,that 1000 gallons of methylamine is worth more in my hands than it is in yours or anyone elses for that matter
5,7,walter,but i need distribution
5,7,walter,distribution
5,7,declan,thats right
5,7,walter,so if you agree to give up your cook and sell my product instead ill give you 35 percent of the take
5,7,declan,wow
5,7,declan,are you kidding me
5,7,declan,me this is a joke
5,7,declan,you know how far we had to stick our necks out to get our hands on this cash
5,7,declan,and why the hell would we want you
5,7,declan,you realize we have our own operation right
5,7,walter,i know all about your operation
5,7,walter,my partners here tell me that you produce a meth thats 70 pure if youre lucky
5,7,walter,what i produce is 99
5,7,walter,1 pure
5,7,walter,so its grade school tball versus the new york yankees
5,7,walter,yours is uh just some tepid offbrand generic cola
5,7,walter,what im making is classic coke
5,7,declan,all right
5,7,declan,okay
5,7,declan,so um if we just waste you right here right now and leave you in the desert then there is no more coke on the market right
5,7,declan,see how that works
5,7,declan,theres only us
5,7,walter,do you really wanna live in a world without coca cola
5,7,walter,my partner tells me that your crew switched to a p2p cook because of our success
5,7,walter,you dye your meth with food coloring to make it look like mine
5,7,walter,you already ape my product at every turn
5,7,walter,but now you have the opportunity to sell it yourself
5,7,declan,i need you to listen to me
5,7,declan,were not gonna give up this deal to be your errand boys do you understand
5,7,declan,for what
5,7,declan,to watch a bunch of junkies get a better high
5,7,walter,a better high means customers pay more
5,7,walter,a higher purity means a greater yield
5,7,walter,thats 130 million dollars a profit that isnt being pissed away by some substandard cook
5,7,walter,now you listen to me
5,7,walter,youve got the greatest meth cook in a no the two greatest meth cooks in america right here and with our skills youll earn more from that 35 than you ever would on your own
5,7,walter,yeah
5,7,declan,so you say
5,7,declan,just wondering why were so lucky
5,7,declan,why cut us in
5,7,walter,mike is retiring from our crew so his share of the partnership is available if you can handle his end distribution
5,7,walter,and if you give him five million dollars of the 15 million that you brought today
5,7,walter,just think of it as a finders fee for bringing us together
5,7,walter,we have 40 pounds of product ready to ship ready to go
5,7,declan,are you ready
5,7,declan,who the hell are ya

5,7,declan, im done
5,7,walter,no youre not
5,7,walter,youre not done
5,7,walter,youre not leaving because if you leave you get nothing
5,7,declan,do you understand me
5,7,jesse,nothing
5,7,walter,jesse
5,7,walter,budget for the current fiscal year for electronic surveillance is 1
5,7,walter,5 million on par with af and the marshal service but still just a fraction of fbi totals
5,7,walter,were lobbying congress for an additional 1
5,7,walter,41 but were waiting on action reports to demonstrate were actually getting worthwhile results
5,7,declan,our undercover operations reap the most successful actionable intelligence if you refer to the chart in appendix four
5,7,declan,if asac schrader can tell us about the surveillance manhours hank
5,7,walter,hank
5,7,walter,hank
5,7,declan,i think were going to wrap this up
5,7,walter,if asac schrader can stay behind while everyone else clears out
5,7,walter,thank you everybody
5,7,declan,you know no one wants to see you succeed at this more than me right
5,7,walter, yes sir
5,7,walter,i know how good you are
5,7,declan,i wouldnt have stuck my neck out to get you here if i didnt
5,7,walter,but youre not knocking down doors anymore bubba
5,7,walter,youre in charge of an entire district office and that comes with responsibilities
5,7,walter,i mean hank basic reports arent being filed in a timely manner
5,7,walter,ill work on it
5,7,declan,itll get better
5,7,walter,yeah it will because way too much time and money is being spent on the fring case a case which is essentially over
5,7,mike,all this overtime to surveil michael ehrmantraut
5,7,walter,thats just money that could be better spent elsewhere
5,7,declan,i understand but im not making these choices lightly
5,7,walter,weve got increased reports of blue meth on the street frings gng is still operational and ehrmantraut is involved
5,7,walter,its that simple
5,7,walter,i believe you
5,7,declan,but so what
5,7,walter,its one case out of dozens and you dont play favorites with it just because it used to be yours
5,7,walter,i really think that  dont play favorites with it hank
5,7,walter,you got a bigger job than that
5,7,declan,i mean forget the financial cost
5,7,declan,i hear youre personally serving search warrants out in the field
5,7,walter,that was an error in judgment
5,7,walter,wont happen again
5,7,declan,youre damn right it wont
5,7,declan,im just gonna bottom line this for you
5,7,declan,the surveillance budget for ehrmantraut is now zero
5,7,mike,we clear
5,7,walter,sure
5,7,walter,thank you
5,7,declan,clear
5,7,walter,good

5,8,walter,its pretty cool the way they do that turn a car into a cube
5,8,lydia,so should we deal with this other thing now
5,8,lydia,yeah
5,8,skyler,sure
5,8,lydia,i dont want to talk about this
5,8,lydia,it had to be done
5,8,walter,all right
5,8,jesse,i need to talk to you
5,8,walter,in private
5,8,jesse,so whats the story

5,8,jesse,so what do we do
5,8,walter,whos we
5,8,skyler,there is no we jesse
5,8,walter,im the only vote left and ill handle it
5,8,walter,my client will supply vital information relating to the organization distribution and production of frings methamphetamine enterprise
5,8,lydia,in exchange we expect all charges to be dropped and dennis not only walks out of here a free man but also receives blanket immunity
5,8,lydia,for what hes gonna be furnishing this deal is plenty fair
5,8,hank,best id be willing to do is queen for a day and reduced charges
5,8,hank,all charges dropped
5,8,hank,queen for a day and a fivek
5,8,lydia,thats the best youre gonna get
5,8,lydia,no way
5,8,walter,guys come on
5,8,lydia,you can be a fairy princess for all i care
5,8,hank,where you going
5,8,lydia,im going shopping for someone who can tell me something i dont already know
5,8,jesse,hey hey
5,8,hank,i got plenty you dont know
5,8,walter,you seem a little confused
5,8,skyler,this here is a buyers market
5,8,lydia,i got eight other assholes just like you four of them within i also got dan the douche bag lawyer whos gonna give me the money and ehrmantraut
5,8,lydia,so settle in dennis
5,8,walter,enjoy your new home
5,8,lydia,im gonna go rattle some cages
5,8,lydia,maybe you should order something
5,8,lydia,do you want a coffee or something
5,8,walter,not just now
5,8,lydia,i think this would play better if you ordered something
5,8,walter,i think this will play just fine and im not thirsty
5,8,walter,so lets take a look at the list
5,8,walter,lydia youve come all this way
5,8,walter,you do have the list
5,8,lydia, yes i have it
5,8,walter,good
5,8,lydia,its just not written down
5,8,walter,and why is that
5,8,lydia,its in my head
5,8,lydia,safer there
5,8,walter,i see
5,8,walter,then i suggest you pick up a pen
5,8,lydia,not just yet
5,8,walter,it was my understanding that attending to these nine names was precisely what you wanted
5,8,lydia,ten names now
5,8,walter,ten counting the lawyer
5,8,lydia,yes
5,8,walter,ten counting the lawyer
5,8,walter,so what am i not tying up loose ends for our mutual benefit
5,8,lydia,youre tying up loose ends and i dont wanna be one of them
5,8,lydia,once i give you that list ive served my purpose and then maybe im just one more person who knows too much
5,8,walter,so you put that list in my hands and in your mind i immediately just mrder you  just right here in this restaurant
5,8,jesse, no
5,8,walter,right here in this public place immediately
5,8,lydia, not right here
5,8,walter,that is not what i  listen lydia
5,8,walter,you made me promise on my childrens lives that i guaranteed your safety
5,8,lydia,from mike
5,8,lydia,you guaranteed id be safe from mike
5,8,lydia,theres no way hed ever go for this you getting rid of his guys
5,8,lydia,you wouldnt be doing this the names if mike were still a factor
5,8,lydia,yeah
5,8,lydia,thats what i thought
5,8,walter,what do you want exactly
5,8,lydia,because if you dont want to give me that list then ive truly got no use for you
5,8,walter,i can grow your business exponentially
5,8,lydia,just give me the list
5,8,walter,i can do that by helping you expand into a larger highly active highly profitable marketplace
5,8,walter,what do you know about the czech republic
5,8,walter,the czech republic
5,8,skyler,did you know theres a higher demand for meth there than anywhere else in europe
5,8,lydia,five percent of its ten million people which is roughly the population of the southwest from western texas to phoenix are using meth
5,8,hank,you keep your market here but by adding overseas sales you can more than double your current profits
5,8,walter,and i checked
5,8,lydia,the average purity is only about 60 percent
5,8,hank,theyve never seen anything like your product
5,8,walter,youll blow their hair back
5,8,hank,shipping internationally seems like courting disaster
5,8,walter,not if youre madrigal
5,8,lydia,madrigal is under investigation by the dea
5,8,walter,the restaurant division mostly
5,8,jesse,weve got 46000 employees spread across 14 divisions
5,8,lydia,and once mikes people are no longer a factor things should tidy up nicely
5,8,walter,this is what i do you understand
5,8,lydia,i move things from point a to point b all over the globe
5,8,hank,a month and all of it right at my fingertips a laptop click away
5,8,skyler,the czech republic whos there on the other end
5,8,jesse,people i ship to regularly
5,8,hank,people ive worked with for years
5,8,hank,theyre professional and very amenable
5,8,skyler,im very careful who i work with
5,8,walter,and if this is such a slam dunk then why didnt you pitch it to fring
5,8,skyler,i did
5,8,lydia,he said yes
5,8,lydia,we were in the final stages of working it out when somebody klled him
5,8,lydia,you dont think gus fring built his distribution network all by himself
5,8,hank,there are considerable advantages to diversification of distribution like putting 6000 miles between you and your product
5,8,walter,at 25 pounds a week im estimating youll gross about two million
5,8,lydia,give me ten pounds to start and well see how it goes
5,8,walter,all right
5,8,lydia,now with fring my end was gonna be 30 percent  which i believe is more than fair
5,8,hank,trust me if you do this  lydia learn to take yes for an answer
5,8,hank,now first things first
5,8,lydia,shake on it
5,8,hank,were going to make a lot of money together
5,8,lydia,todd i think its time i meet your uncle
5,8,skyler,no iron pile
5,8,walter,theres too many muscleheads flexing their shit
5,8,lydia,too many eyes
5,8,jesse,okay so no chow line no yard
5,8,skyler,gonna keep it simple
5,8,lydia,passbyes
5,8,lydia,yeah
5,8,lydia,hallways shower room cells
5,8,jesse,the easy stuff
5,8,lydia,i say we go with a riot
5,8,walter,our boys get it done in a riot
5,8,jesse,no no no
5,8,hank,no chaos
5,8,hank,i dont want the goon squad rolling in and stealing our shot you know
5,8,hank,this has gotta be fast and quiet
5,8,lydia,just boom boom boom
5,8,walter,you know what im saying
5,8,walter, yeah
5,8,walter,thats what its gotta be
5,8,jesse,so how many guys we got at mdc
5,8,walter,three counting shaddock
5,8,lydia,and he makes the schedule now so we can put who we need where we need them
5,8,walter,all right
5,8,skyler,so mdcs covered
5,8,jesse,what about the rest
5,8,walter,we need g block in valencia right
5,8,walter,our guys on the night shift
5,8,skyler,have him pull a double
5,8,hank,his supervisors got some hardon about ot
5,8,hank,have him switch with somebody
5,8,skyler,i dont know
5,8,skyler,just get it done
5,8,walter,regardless you know we got enough guys in valencia right now
5,8,hank,might have to hire out
5,8,hank,you high
5,8,hank,mix blood with chuntaros
5,8,lydia, no way
5,8,lydia,well theres no need
5,8,skyler,we got enough
5,8,walter,hitters aint the problem
5,8,walter,its that short walking window after lunch
5,8,walter,mmhmm
5,8,lydia,yeah
5,8,walter,its gonna be tight
5,8,jesse,real tight
5,8,hank,you know i gotta be straight with you man
5,8,walter,taking out all these guys is doable
5,8,hank,but hitting them in three separate jails all within two minutes
5,8,walter,whacking bin laden wasnt this complicated
5,8,skyler,where do you suppose these come from
5,8,lydia,ive seen this one before
5,8,lydia,i wonder are they all in some giant warehouse someplace
5,8,jesse,hey
5,8,walter,it can be done just not the way you want it
5,8,lydia,it can be done exactly how i want it
5,8,lydia,the only question is are you the man to do it
5,8,skyler,figure it out
5,8,walter,thats what im paying you for
5,8,walter,whats happening
5,8,lydia,no man
5,8,walter,help me

5,8,lydia,new details have emerged in the spate of jail deaths that rocked central new mexico three days ago
5,8,walter,as of yet no names of victims have been released but authorities continue to investigate what appears to be a carefully coordinated sequence of attcks that occurred within minutes of one another in three different correctional facilities  is it okay if i turn this off
5,8,walter, oh sure

5,9,walter,i wanna beat this thing
5,9,saul,i do
5,9,walter,im back on chemo and i am fighting like hell
5,9,walter,but the truth is in six months you wont have someone to prosecute
5,9,walter,but even even if somehow you were able to convince anyone i was capable of doing these things you and i both know i would never see the inside of a jail cell
5,9,walter,im a dying man who runs a car wash
5,9,walter,my right hand to god that is all that i am
5,9,saul,whats the point
5,9,hank,have skyler bring the kids here and then well talk
5,9,walter,that is not going to happen
5,9,hank,i dont know who you are
5,9,hank,i dont even know who im talking to
5,9,walter,if thats true if you dont know who i am then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly
5,10,hank,i knew there would be a drop in quality but 68
5,10,hank,this is not what i agreed to
5,10,saul,i left a viable operation the rest was up to you
5,10,hank,all along it was you
5,10,hank,hank my cancer is back
5,10,skyler,in six months you wont have someone to prosecute
5,10,hank,here

5,10,hank,she didnt say where she was going
5,10,hank,skyler my my head is spinning
5,10,hank,and yours i i cant even imagine
5,10,hank,so much makes sense to me now
5,10,saul,you jumping in the pool you sending us your kids i get it
5,10,hank,i just wished id seen it sooner
5,10,hank,hes a monster
5,10,hank,hes a look i dont know what he did to you to force you to keep his secrets
5,10,hank,if he threatened you or whatever mind games he played
5,10,hank,i dont know if there was abuse
5,10,hank,but i want you to know that you can be open with me
5,10,hank,dont hold anything back okay
5,10,hank,i mean i dont even understand if you know the full extent of this what hes done
5,10,hank,not just the meth cooking but the lives hes destroyed
5,10,hank,but look thats all behind you
5,10,hank,starting now
5,10,hank,youre done being his victim
5,10,hank,because heres what were gonna do
5,10,hank,sky
5,10,hank,heres what were gonna do
5,10,hank,you and the kids are gonna move back to our house where youll be safe where he cant get to you
5,10,skyler,hank does marie no
5,10,hank,well get to that soon enough
5,10,hank,its just you and me right now okay
5,10,hank,okay
5,10,hank,before we um before we get you back to the house i im gonna ask you to tell me everything you can
5,10,hank,um take as long as you like
5,10,hank,just uh start from the beginning when you first became aware of walts activities and just just try to be as detailed as you can
5,10,skyler,uh what right right here
5,10,hank,right now
5,10,hank,sure
5,10,hank,why not
5,10,hank,while its still fresh you know
5,10,hank,and just uh just uh remember to uh just state your name and the date before you start
5,10,skyler,hank do do we have to have to do this right now
5,10,skyler,no we we dont have to do this right now
5,10,hank,but just heres the thing
5,10,hank,you see i need something solid that i can bring to my people
5,10,hank,a statement on the record
5,10,hank,so you testifying to walts criminal activity whatever you know goes a long long way here
5,10,hank,okay
5,10,hank,i mean you see building a case this big gathering all this evidence enough to get a conviction were talking a longhaul proposition here and i dont want that bastard running out the clock
5,10,saul,but with your testimony wait what do you mean running out the clock
5,10,hank,his cancer
5,10,hank,his cancers back
5,10,saul,so he said
5,10,hank,he didnt tell you
5,10,hank,whos to say its even true
5,10,hank,lying piece of shit
5,10,hank,look regardless i mean well just assume
5,10,hank,fine
5,10,hank,okay
5,10,hank,you know what
5,10,hank,that son of a btch looks me in the eye and he says if what i know is true if hell be dead before i can prove it
5,10,hank,the balls on that son of a i got all these little pieces
5,10,hank,theyre all part of the story right
5,10,hank,but they dont mean much on their own
5,10,hank,but when you start telling me what you know when you start filling in the gaps ill have him in lockup before the sun goes down
5,10,skyler,hank i i i think maybe maybe i need a lawyer
5,10,hank,what
5,10,saul,no no no no you dont
5,10,skyler,i i think maybe i do
5,10,hank,skyler understand i am here to help you
5,10,hank,but to do that i need your help
5,10,hank,we start bringing in lawyers and they start putting up roadblocks where they dont need to be and my ability to control this situation diminishes
5,10,skyler,just for my own protection it just you know it seems to make sense that i should have someone to talk to
5,10,hank,skyler im your your biggest advocate here and im telling you for your own good you need to get out ahead of this thing
5,10,hank,i mean you start you know getting defensive i im not saying its right but ill tell you its a fact the da will look at you differently
5,10,hank,but you dont know that
5,10,hank,skyler yes i i do
5,10,hank,ive been around long enough to know
5,10,hank,its in your best interest to get out there and show the world you have nothing to hide
5,10,hank,look no one in the world is more important to me than your sister
5,10,hank,so believe me when i tell you that your best interest and mine are the same
5,10,skyler,but hank you telling me not to talk to a lawyer doesnt sound like that at all
5,10,skyler,it sounds like what you want what you want is to get walt
5,10,skyler,at all costs
5,10,hank,okay
5,10,hank,okay lets just slow down
5,10,hank,slow down
5,10,hank,you can you can talk to a lawyer later
5,10,hank,but right now what we need to do we need to go get the kids we need to bring them to my house where theyre safe and then we need to help each other put this animal away okay
5,10,hank,come on
5,10,skyler,hank
5,10,hank,no come on
5,10,hank,lets go to the house and well deal with it there
5,10,hank,come on

5,10,walter,without a moments hesitation
5,10,saul,im not saying its not bad
5,10,saul,its bad
5,10,saul,but it could be worse

5,10,saul,what does she actually know
5,10,saul,what has she seen hmm
5,10,saul,nothing
5,10,saul,its hearsay
5,10,saul,its all he said she said

5,10,walter,hank knows
5,10,walter,thats not nothing
5,10,saul,yeah
5,10,saul,i cant exactly see him turning the other cheek
5,10,saul,of course theres always um always what

5,11,walter,right so there i am im on top of the train pumping the water in and hes watching to make sure we put in exactly what he calculated
5,11,hank,and we gotta be real precise because water and methylene weigh different and he like figured it all out to the like milliliter
5,11,skyler,anyway im up there with my hose and were going as fast as we can
5,11,walter,cause we only got a few minutes
5,11,walter,at the crossing we got this guy whos smoothtalking the engineer
5,11,walter,and its all just going great until this other dude shows up in this monster truck so were pretty much screwed because he can just push the entire dump truck off the tracks which you know is what he does
5,11,jesse,whats your guy doing
5,11,jesse,you cant stop him
5,11,hank,yeah
5,11,walter,but whats he gonna say
5,11,hank,thanks anyway sir but my friends are still stealing cargo back there
5,11,jesse,anyway so im looking all around cause i know were not done but the gallons are just slowly ticking away
5,11,walter,and finally mr
5,11,jesse,white tells me to cut it
5,11,walter,and so i fling the hose im grabbing the cap im screwing in the bolts
5,11,jesse,just like busting ass you know
5,11,walter,and um and then i feel the train start moving
5,11,skyler,youre  im on top
5,11,hank,did you piss your pants
5,11,hank,yeah right
5,11,walter,so the thing starts speeding up so i jump off the moving train
5,11,jesse,like total stuntman stuff

5,11,skyler,you ever see hooper
5,11,hank,oh hey man burt reynolds
5,11,saul,good movie
5,11,kuby,but he jumped out of a helicopter not a train
5,11,walter,well whatever man
5,11,walter,its a good movie
5,11,walter,and this guy jesse hes underneath the thing and the train just drives right over him
5,11,hank,and luckily hes hes this skinny little guy
5,11,walter,damn
5,11,walter,thats a tight operation
5,11,walter,it was it was perfect
5,11,saul,no one even knew they got robbed just like we planned
5,11,jesse,white told me it was like the biggest train heist ever like potential moneywise
5,11,walter,so thats how that happened
5,11,jesse,can i get you anything else

5,11,walter,i got this
5,11,jesse,all right
5,11,hank,lets make some money then
5,11,walter,i gotta hit the head

5,11,walter,is that hank should just let it go and wait for you to die

5,11,walter,that is not a solution
5,11,hank,no its not a solution
5,11,walter,hes not getting off that easy

5,11,jesse,never gonna happen
5,11,walter,that is not what were saying enough with the bullshit
5,11,jesse,youre not gonna negotiate your way out of this thing
5,11,hank,theres only one solution step up be a man and admit what youve done
5,11,walter,thats it
5,11,jesse,there is no other option
5,11,jesse,lets go
5,11,walter,my name is walter hartwell white
5,11,walter,i live at albuquerque new mexico 87104
5,11,walter,this is my confession
5,11,walter,if youre watching this tape im probably dead mrderd by my brotherinlaw hank schrader
5,11,walter,hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist
5,11,walter,shortly after my 50th birthday he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the dea
5,11,walter,i was astounded
5,11,walter,i i always thought hank was a very moral man and i was particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of
5,11,walter,i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family
5,11,walter,hank took me on a ridealong and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make
5,11,walter,and i was weak
5,11,walter,i didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed
5,11,walter,hank had a partner a businessman named gustavo fring
5,11,walter,hank sold me into servitude to this man and when i tried to quit fring threatened my family
5,11,walter,i didnt know where to turn
5,11,walter,eventually hank and fring had a falling out and things escalated
5,11,walter,fring was able to arrange uh i guess i guess you call it a hit on hank and failed but he was seriously injured and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over 177000
5,11,walter,upon recovery hank was bent on revenge
5,11,walter,working with a man named hector salamanca he plotted to kll fring
5,11,walter,the bmb that he used was built by me
5,11,walter,and he gave me no option in that
5,11,walter,i have often contemplated su1c1de but im a coward
5,11,walter,i wanted to go to the police but i was frightened
5,11,walter,hank had risen to become the head of the albuquerque dea to keep me in line he took my children
5,11,walter,for three months he kept them
5,11,walter,my wife who had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what i had done
5,11,walter,i was in hell
5,11,walter,i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family
5,11,walter,recently i tried once again to quit and in response he gave me this
5,11,walter,i cant take this anymore
5,11,walter,i live in fear every day that hank will kll me or worse hurt my family
5,11,walter,i all i could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is
5,11,marie,who do you think hes shown this to
5,11,hank,no one
5,11,kuby,its a threat
5,11,hank,its what he will do if i dont back off
5,11,marie,i think you should show this to ramey
5,11,marie,just get ahead of it
5,11,marie,that video is a bunch of lies hank
5,11,marie,anybody who knows you will know
5,11,walter,177000
5,11,hank,hells he talking about
5,11,hank,marie
5,11,marie,they told me it was gambling money
5,11,hank,what was gambling money
5,11,hank,oh jesus christ marie
5,11,hank,oh god no
5,11,marie,how was i supposed to know
5,11,marie,how was i supposed to know where it really came from
5,11,hank,why were they paying for my medical bills
5,11,hank,what about my insurance
5,11,marie,insurance wouldnt have covered the treatment that you needed and i i just wanted the best for you
5,11,hank,why didnt you tell me
5,11,marie,because i knew that you would refuse it and without it you may never have been able to walk again
5,11,hank,oh christ marie
5,11,jesse,you klled me here
5,11,hank,i mean its the thats the last nail
5,11,hank,thats the last nail in the coffin
5,11,marie,what do we do
5,11,hank,if i were you id be more nervous
5,11,walter,ugh
5,11,hank,jesus
5,11,walter,its always a desert
5,11,kuby,uh i already checked it
5,11,walter,its clean
5,11,marie,i wouldnt have driven it here if it wasnt
5,11,walter,um get one of these by the way
5,11,jesse,reads radio signals
5,11,walter,much easier
5,11,walter,what does he know
5,11,hank,i mean he knows youre heisenberg
5,11,jesse,but i figure not much else otherwise you know youd be locked up
5,11,walter,what did he say exactly
5,11,jesse,he wants me to inform on you for him
5,11,skyler,tell him everything we did
5,11,walter,anything else
5,11,walter,i dont think hes told the rest of the dea
5,11,jesse,why do you say that
5,11,hank,just him being there all by himself and plus he was acting kinda shady
5,11,walter,seemed like he didnt want the other cops hearing what he had to say
5,11,walter,are we gonna talk about the rain of caca the kid brought down upon us
5,11,hank,do you want to hazard a guess what his little charity drive cost you
5,11,hank,why dont you go take a walk saul

5,12,hank,i i know
5,12,marie,this is short notice and i really appreciate it
5,12,skyler,sir sir wed love to take more of your money but youve got gas soaked straight through to your subfloor
5,12,kuby,until you pull this up and get new carpet new padding this is as good as it gets
5,12,walter,is that gasoline
5,12,saul,ask dad
5,12,walter,hey
5,12,walter,over here
5,12,marie,what happened
5,12,skyler,what happened is that i should sue someone
5,12,walter,thats what happened
5,12,skyler,so im on my way to the drugstore and i have to stop to get some gas and there is this total pump malfunction
5,12,jesse,you know what
5,12,kuby,she really shouldnt be in this room at all
5,12,jesse,i mean this is supposedly green but you know how it is
5,12,kuby,you can close the windows in the nursery because its really only out here
5,12,skyler,ugh
5,12,hank,this is as good as it gets
5,12,walter,so um pump malfunction
5,12,kuby,yeah
5,12,hank,so im standing there filling up like ive done a thousand times before and i hear a chunk
5,12,saul,you know the pumps nozzle
5,12,kuby,the the metal thing
5,12,kuby,the thing you squeeze right
5,12,jesse,i hear a chunk
5,12,kuby,so i suppose in my naivete i took to understand that gas is no longer coming out of the nozzle so i pull out the hose to put it back and whoosh
5,12,hank,you know i am suddenly soaked in gasoline
5,12,skyler,i mean on my arms and my legs and my my groin
5,12,kuby,so now i am in a panic and i race home i run inside the house and im stripping off my clothes as fast as i can
5,12,saul,i jump in the shower
5,12,kuby,its not until after i get out of the shower that i realize my gascovered clothes have been soaking in the living room rug this entire time
5,12,kuby,i mean its its the whole thing is just so stupid
5,12,walter,i could have rinsed off at the station
5,12,kuby,halfway home im starting to realize wait a minute theres a water hose right there next to the air pump
5,12,saul,you know for tires
5,12,kuby,anyway so that was my day
5,12,jesse,how was yours
5,12,saul, dad

5,12,walter,cause youre sick again
5,12,kuby,you were pumping gas and the fumes they they made you pass out again
5,12,walter,just just admit it
5,12,saul,no the no
5,12,kuby,it was the pump
5,12,saul,all right i i maybe i did get a little swimmy at one point but i did not faint
5,12,saul,okay
5,12,hank,im fine and thats the truth
5,12,kuby,however in the best interest of all of our continued good health i dont think we can stay here
5,12,skyler,i mean not until we get new carpet
5,12,kuby,yeah
5,12,skyler,uncle hank and aunt marie they they got plenty of space
5,12,kuby,hey what about a hotel

5,12,walter,that could be sweet
5,12,kuby,a a good one
5,12,kuby,i like the way youre thinking
5,12,hank,could be a little family vacation
5,12,hank,might be fun
5,12,walter,what do you say
5,12,skyler,why dont you put some clothes together
5,12,kuby,yeah
5,12,kuby,all right
5,12,kuby,im sorry
5,12,hank,its not my finest hour
5,12,kuby,ill go pack a bag
5,12,saul,okay
5,12,saul,okay
5,12,kuby,think thisll leave a scar
5,12,saul,i never should have let my dojo membership run out
5,12,walter,jesus
5,12,walter,jesse did that
5,12,saul,yeah but you gotta understand deep down he loves me
5,12,walter,so where is he
5,12,kuby, still looking
5,12,walter,where have you looked
5,12,kuby,his place his folks place uh this brock kids place
5,12,kuby,crack shacks at siesta hills the indigo the crystal palace gokart joint on copper ave
5,12,kuby,uh aa meeting off the 40
5,12,walter,his buddies beaver and whatshisname
5,12,kuby,uh badger and skinny pete
5,12,kuby,yeah no hes not with them
5,12,walter,they could be covering for him
5,12,kuby,i posed as a meter reader
5,12,kuby,i put a bug in the tall kids moms place
5,12,kuby,for three hours straight all he talked about was something called babylon 5
5,12,kuby,i checked with my gal at apd
5,12,kuby,uh she said pinkmans not in their system so the cops dont have him
5,12,saul,yet
5,12,walter,maybe he changed his mind about leaving called your guy back
5,12,saul,somebody misses their first chance with my guy theres no second
5,12,walter,well keep looking
5,12,saul,what then
5,12,walter,what do you mean
5,12,saul,i mean pinkmans like a bad penny
5,12,saul,sooner or later hes gonna turn up
5,12,saul,im wondering what you wanna do when he does
5,12,walter,jesse is upset about the boy
5,12,walter,i just need to explain to him why that had to happen
5,12,saul,okay but say you know just for the sake of argument the kids not in the mood for a nuanced discussion of the virtues of child poisoning
5,12,saul,you know his plans are running more towards stabbing you to death with a pointed stick
5,12,saul,in that scenario then what
5,12,walter,you have a suggestion
5,12,saul,we were wondering if maybe this isnt an old yeller type situation
5,12,saul,old yeller
5,12,saul,yeah old yeller was the best most loyal dog there ever was
5,12,saul,i mean everybody loved that mutt but one day he showed up rabid and little timmy for old yellers own sake had to uh oh you you saw the movie
5,12,walter,youre full of colorful metaphors arent you saul
5,12,walter,belize old yeller
5,12,walter,just brimming with advice
5,12,walter,do not float that idea again
5,12,walter,find him
5,12,skyler,room key wouldnt let me into the ice room so i had to go down to the front desk
5,12,skyler,but here we are
5,12,kuby,checked in on junior
5,12,skyler,payperview and room service
5,12,hank,hes in heaven
5,12,hank,hey i thought you were gonna take a bath
5,12,saul,hows saul doing
5,12,walter,saul
5,12,marie,goodman
5,12,hank,i have no idea
5,12,hank,you were just out talking to him in the parking lot
5,12,kuby,im sorry
5,12,saul,were you spying on me
5,12,walter,and i feel just awful about it too
5,12,kuby,you know i played along with your pump malfunction bullshit because junior was standing right there but now i would like to know whats going on
5,12,hank,first of all its no big deal
5,12,jesse,coming here is just me being overly cautious
5,12,jesse,jesse pinkman you know
5,12,kuby,he came over to the house that time for dinner remember
5,12,kuby,well he he got upset over this something he thinks i did
5,12,walter,i did do it
5,12,saul,but i did it for very good reasons
5,12,walter,its just its complicated
5,12,skyler,are you are you telling me that he tried to burn our house down
5,12,walter,that was probably for a brief moment his intention but obviously he changed his mind
5,12,walter,and how does that work
5,12,walter,him him changing his mind
5,12,walter,ah god
5,12,skyler,look with youve got to understand
5,12,walter,with with jesse there are emotional issues personal issues some drug abuse
5,12,kuby,but he has always been more of a danger to himself than anyone else
5,12,kuby,he has a tendency to fly off the handle
5,12,kuby,thats all
5,12,kuby,so he has never hurt anybody
5,12,skyler,i cant believe you got her down so fast
5,12,skyler,oh so whats your course of action here
5,12,walter,sauls guy kuby tracks him down which shouldnt take long and when he does im gonna im gonna talk to him
5,12,skyler,make him see reason
5,12,walter,talk to him
5,12,skyler,make him see reason
5,12,skyler, so im clear these are just euphemisms youre using here right
5,12,walter,what
5,12,walter,whwhat does that mean
5,12,walter,my god
5,12,skyler,i knew this was going to happen
5,12,skyler,i knew it
5,12,skyler,i told you that someday someone was going to come to our door and try to hurt us

5,12,walter,jesse didnt go there to hurt anyone
5,12,skyler,he poured gasoline all over our house walt
5,12,skyler,he tried to set our house on fire
5,12,walter,he changed his mind
5,12,walter,he didnt do it did he
5,12,walter,what if he changes it back
5,12,skyler,walt you need to deal with this
5,12,walter,how much have you had to drink
5,12,skyler,not nearly enough
5,12,walter,i i dont know how we got off on whatever it is were talking about here
5,12,walter,but clearly i havent explained the situation well enough because this is a big overreaction
5,12,walter,we all need to just take a deep breath and calm down because jesse isnt just some some some rabid dog

5,12,skyler,a person that is a threat to us

5,13,hank,i am correct in assuming this should be blue
5,13,hank,see im thinking the headline here should be 76
5,13,hank, yeah
5,13,jesse,whole lot more than it was
5,13,jesse,that dude who looked like wolverine he couldnt crack 70
5,13,walter,fine
5,13,walter,yes percentagewise its marginally improved
5,13,hank,and congratulations todd
5,13,jesse,but blue is our brand
5,13,jesse,all over europe its what our buyers pay top dollar for
5,13,jesse,if were down a bit in purity from the heisenberg days maybe theyll let us slide on that but not if its not blue
5,13,walter,i dont know

5,13,hank,its blueish
5,13,walter,todd youre the chef
5,13,jesse,what do you think

5,13,hank,hell well put food coloring in it
5,13,jesse,make it any damn shade you want
5,13,hank,yeah

5,13,saul, oh dont take it personally
5,13,jesse,goodmans next on the chopping block if he doesnt do what white says
5,13,walter,and to be fair your uh circus clown of a boss did try to spare you for all of what about 15 seconds before he decided to help walt track you down
5,13,jesse,you see goodmans got a trace on your phone and as soon as you call him uh walts gonna find out where youre hiding out

5,13,gomez,so just tell us everything you know about white so we can get him before he gets you
5,13,hank,who knows with this guy
5,13,hank,from what he said to goodman it may have something to do with him trying to tie up loose ends regarding his poisoning some kid named brock
5,13,hank,or maybe its cause you know where his money is
5,13,gomez,that aint what we heard
5,13,jesse,me and kuby rented a van for the dude loaded his cash up in a selfstorage unit handed over the keys to him at goodmans

5,14,walter,and then i think about how you are so upset with walt and how you wanted the kids out of the house and all of this makes me believe that there has got to be hope for you that whatever he did to you can be undone

5,15,jack,hello
5,15,jack,hello
5,15,elliott,sir are you still there
5,15,saul,you ready for that drink now
5,15,saul,dimple pinch
5,15,saul,neat
5,15,todd,you got it
5,15,walter,for us its always been science first and wait
5,15,todd,would you would you would you go back please
5,15,charlie,more of a byproduct
5,15,elliott,there
5,15,elliott,exactly
5,15,elliott,what this
5,15,walter,yes
5,15,charlie,but just yesterday your charity the gretchen and elliott schwartz foundation announced a 28 million grant for drug abuse treatment centers throughout the southwest
5,15,elliott,charlie the southwest is our home and we couldnt just ignore whats going on in our own backyard
5,15,charlie,but im sure youre aware that there are people who suggest other motives
5,15,charlie,andrew ross sorkin of the new york times wrote a column suggesting that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver to sure up the stock price of gray matter technologies because of your association with walter white
5,15,charlie,well thats not exactly the way to cleanse yourselves so to speak of having a methamphetamine kingpin as cofounder of your company
5,15,elliott,charlie im glad you brought that up
5,15,elliott,i have to believe that the investing public understands were talking about a person who who was there early on but who had virtually nothing to do with the creation of the company and still less to do with growing it into what it is today
5,15,charlie,so what was walter whites contribution
5,15,elliott,you know to be honest honey
5,15,elliott, the company name
5,15,elliott,the company name
5,15,elliott,we came up with it by combining our names
5,15,elliott,uh schwartz means black black plus white makes gray
5,15,charlie,its gray matter technologies
5,15,elliott,exactly
5,15,elliott,as far as i can recall his contribution begins and ends right there

5,16,walter,hello gretchen
5,16,walter,elliott
5,16,walter,i really like your new house
5,16,elliott,walt
5,16,walter,this are we looking east
5,16,walter,my god you must have one great view of the sangre de cristos
5,16,walter,walt what what are you doing here
5,16,walter,i saw you on charlie rose
5,16,walter,you looked great
5,16,walter,you both did
5,16,walter,if you are here to to hurt us walt whatever it is youre planning actually im here to give you something
5,16,walter,its out in my car
5,16,walter,how about the three of us take a walk to it
5,16,walter,its just parked down the road
5,16,walter,i couldnt get it past your gate
5,16,walter,elliott if were gonna go that way youll need a bigger knife
5,16,walter,keep stacking
5,16,walter,itll all fit
5,16,walter,thats all right
5,16,walter,just just throw it on top
5,16,walter,gretchen would you mind
5,16,walter,we dont want to lose any under the furniture
5,16,walter,all right
5,16,walter,that is 9720000
5,16,gretchen,where did it come from
5,16,gretchen,and why is it here
5,16,walter,i earned it and youre going to give it to my children
5,16,gretchen,what
5,16,elliott,why
5,16,walter,walt i dont think we on my sons 18th birthday which is ten months and two days from today you will give him this money in the form of an irrevocable trust
5,16,walter,you will tell him that it is his to do with as he sees fit but with the hope that he uses it for his college education
5,16,walter,and for the betterment of his family
5,16,elliott,walt im not sure that we follow
5,16,gretchen,why uh i mean why in particular would we if you wanna give your kids drug money go do it yourself
5,16,walter,i cant
5,16,walter,my wife and son hate me
5,16,walter,they wont take my money
5,16,walter,even if they did the federal government wouldnt let them
5,16,walter,but two rich benefactors who are known for their charitable endeavors who would think nothing of for instance writing a 28 million check to help victims of methamphetamine abuse
5,16,walter,i have to think that your money would be very welcome
5,16,gretchen,it wouldnt make any sense coming from us
5,16,walter,it certainly would
5,16,walter,my children are blameless victims of their monstrous father
5,16,walter,a man who you once knew quite well
5,16,walter,call it a beau geste call it liberal guilt call it whatever you want but do it
5,16,walter,and you are not to spend a single dime of your own money
5,16,walter,if there are taxes or lawyers fees owed you will take it right from here
5,16,walter,they use my money never yours
5,16,elliott,okay walt sure
5,16,elliott,that that sounds reasonable
5,16,elliott,so what happens next
5,16,walter,i guess we shake on it and i leave
5,16,walter,i can trust you to do this
5,16,elliott,yes
5,16,walter,absolutely you can
5,16,walter,dont move
5,16,walter,dont dont dare move a muscle
5,16,walter,you dont want them to think that youre trying to get away
5,16,walter,just breathe
5,16,walter,just this afternoon i had an extra 200000 that i would have loved dearly to leave on top of this table
5,16,walter,instead i gave it to the two best hitmen west of the mississippi
5,16,walter,now whatever happens to me tomorrow theyll still be out there
5,16,walter,keeping tabs
5,16,walter,and if for any reason that my children do not get this money a kind of countdown will begin
5,16,walter,maybe a day or so later maybe a week a year when youre going for a walk in santa fe or manhattan or prague wherever and youre talking about your stock prices without a worry in the world
5,16,walter,and then suddenly youll hear the scrape of a footstep behind you but before you can even turn around  pop
5,16,walter,darkness
5,16,walter,cheer up beautiful people
5,16,walter,this is where you get to make it right
